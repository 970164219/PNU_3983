00:00:01,01 --> 00:00:02,07
- The supply and demand ratio

2
00:00:02,07 --> 00:00:05,05
often favors talent over employers.

3
00:00:05,05 --> 00:00:08,09
Employers and recruiters need to make a pitch

4
00:00:08,09 --> 00:00:11,07
that their business provides awesome opportunities

5
00:00:11,07 --> 00:00:15,01
as places to work, and has great people to work with.

6
00:00:15,01 --> 00:00:18,03
Employees want an employer that really understands

7
00:00:18,03 --> 00:00:22,02
and values UX, and understands the difference between UX

8
00:00:22,02 --> 00:00:26,08
and other aspects of the creation process, like development.

9
00:00:26,08 --> 00:00:29,00
They want an employer that understands that there are

10
00:00:29,00 --> 00:00:31,02
multiple skill sets within UX,

11
00:00:31,02 --> 00:00:34,00
even if the employer needs more than one skill set,

12
00:00:34,00 --> 00:00:37,03
and even if they themselves represent more than one

13
00:00:37,03 --> 00:00:39,03
of those skill sets.

14
00:00:39,03 --> 00:00:43,04
They want an employer who values people as much as they do,

15
00:00:43,04 --> 00:00:46,03
and an employer that values them and supports them

16
00:00:46,03 --> 00:00:48,07
becoming better UX professionals,

17
00:00:48,07 --> 00:00:51,08
helping them grow their knowledge and skills.

18
00:00:51,08 --> 00:00:54,09
Those skills need to grow with work that challenges them

19
00:00:54,09 --> 00:00:58,09
to think creatively as they make a difference.

20
00:00:58,09 --> 00:01:00,07
And they want to be able to work

21
00:01:00,07 --> 00:01:04,06
with like-minded individuals, others who care about UX

22
00:01:04,06 --> 00:01:07,00
as much as they do.

23
00:01:07,00 --> 00:01:10,04
Think about it, you only have a moment to tell people

24
00:01:10,04 --> 00:01:13,02
why your business is awesome as you pitch

25
00:01:13,02 --> 00:01:14,09
coming to work for the business.

26
00:01:14,09 --> 00:01:17,02
Maybe at a networking event,

27
00:01:17,02 --> 00:01:19,01
and maybe when they're actually in front of you

28
00:01:19,01 --> 00:01:21,01
for a job interview.

29
00:01:21,01 --> 00:01:23,03
As you start to think about what you would say,

30
00:01:23,03 --> 00:01:26,06
here are some recommendations.

31
00:01:26,06 --> 00:01:28,03
When you make an elevator pitch,

32
00:01:28,03 --> 00:01:31,03
frame your specific staffing needs in a way that shows

33
00:01:31,03 --> 00:01:35,07
that you understand what user experience is about.

34
00:01:35,07 --> 00:01:36,09
Are you specific?

35
00:01:36,09 --> 00:01:39,09
What exciting projects are you working on?

36
00:01:39,09 --> 00:01:42,05
How will your corporate mission resonate with the people?

37
00:01:42,05 --> 00:01:46,01
Did you think about what the office environment is like?

38
00:01:46,01 --> 00:01:48,08
Do you mention your exceptional lifestyle benefits?

39
00:01:48,08 --> 00:01:51,01
Did you include how you're a place that supports

40
00:01:51,01 --> 00:01:53,02
both work and play?

41
00:01:53,02 --> 00:01:56,02
Your pitch is also about you.

42
00:01:56,02 --> 00:01:59,01
What makes it clear that you know what you're talking about

43
00:01:59,01 --> 00:02:01,05
and that you have legitimate UX knowledge

44
00:02:01,05 --> 00:02:07,00
and the expertise necessary to hire what's really needed?

45
00:02:07,00 --> 00:02:09,07
Practice your elevator pitch in phone conversations

46
00:02:09,07 --> 00:02:10,08
and in person.

47
00:02:10,08 --> 00:02:13,08
Iterate your pitch at meet-ups and events.

48
00:02:13,08 --> 00:02:15,08
Carefully watch the reaction of listeners

49
00:02:15,08 --> 00:02:18,02
to figure out what is inspiring to them

50
00:02:18,02 --> 00:02:21,03
and what causes their eyes to glaze over.

51
00:02:21,03 --> 00:02:24,01
No matter what, be honest.

52
00:02:24,01 --> 00:02:26,02
Don't try to sell what your business is not.

53
00:02:26,02 --> 00:02:28,09
Don't try to sell work that you don't have.

54
00:02:28,09 --> 00:02:32,05
An inspiring but inaccurate pitch could get people in,

55
00:02:32,05 --> 00:02:36,02
but misaligned expectations will cause you to lose

56
00:02:36,02 --> 00:02:39,09
those good people and generate ill will very quickly.

57
00:02:39,09 --> 00:02:44,00
So stay honest and inspiring and pull in those job seekers.
