00:00:01,00 --> 00:00:02,05
- Over the course of your project,

2
00:00:02,05 --> 00:00:04,00
employees may have established

3
00:00:04,00 --> 00:00:07,00
and effective methods of communicating with each other.

4
00:00:07,00 --> 00:00:11,01
But a short-term resource may not be as fully dialed in.

5
00:00:11,01 --> 00:00:14,00
So make sure to keep them in the loop too.

6
00:00:14,00 --> 00:00:16,03
While you have less control over a contractor's schedule

7
00:00:16,03 --> 00:00:17,08
and work than your employees,

8
00:00:17,08 --> 00:00:19,06
you can partially compensate for this

9
00:00:19,06 --> 00:00:22,00
with regular communication.

10
00:00:22,00 --> 00:00:24,06
From the outset let your contractors know

11
00:00:24,06 --> 00:00:26,06
that they have an open channel of communication

12
00:00:26,06 --> 00:00:30,00
with your team and be specific about how communication

13
00:00:30,00 --> 00:00:33,06
would be most easily facilitated from your side.

14
00:00:33,06 --> 00:00:35,09
This is true whether they've allocated office space

15
00:00:35,09 --> 00:00:39,06
in your work area or they're in a different time zone.

16
00:00:39,06 --> 00:00:42,00
At a project level, as we talked about,

17
00:00:42,00 --> 00:00:44,06
that communication starts with the contract.

18
00:00:44,06 --> 00:00:46,06
And at a project level it extends

19
00:00:46,06 --> 00:00:48,04
through the project life cycle,

20
00:00:48,04 --> 00:00:50,08
both when the project starts and how the work

21
00:00:50,08 --> 00:00:53,07
ebbs and flows over the duration.

22
00:00:53,07 --> 00:00:56,08
This person likely also has their own preconceived ideas

23
00:00:56,08 --> 00:00:58,08
about what deliverables will look like

24
00:00:58,08 --> 00:01:01,03
based on prior work that they've done.

25
00:01:01,03 --> 00:01:03,05
If you want them to produce you X deliverables

26
00:01:03,05 --> 00:01:05,04
that match what your team has done before,

27
00:01:05,04 --> 00:01:07,04
communicate there too.

28
00:01:07,04 --> 00:01:09,07
Show them some examples and let them use

29
00:01:09,07 --> 00:01:13,07
the actual documents as templates for their deliverables.

30
00:01:13,07 --> 00:01:16,01
We'll talk shortly about UXer's being somewhere between

31
00:01:16,01 --> 00:01:18,01
introversion and extroversion,

32
00:01:18,01 --> 00:01:20,03
but for the moment just know that the people

33
00:01:20,03 --> 00:01:22,00
you bring on as contractors

34
00:01:22,00 --> 00:01:24,07
may have personality elements that combine a desire

35
00:01:24,07 --> 00:01:27,01
to be social and have in-person interactions

36
00:01:27,01 --> 00:01:29,02
with time alone focused on creating

37
00:01:29,02 --> 00:01:31,00
what needs to get created.

38
00:01:31,00 --> 00:01:33,05
So particularly if your resource is local,

39
00:01:33,05 --> 00:01:35,08
if you can give them the option to work in person

40
00:01:35,08 --> 00:01:38,03
with your team sometimes, do it.

41
00:01:38,03 --> 00:01:41,02
That said, don't require them to always be on site

42
00:01:41,02 --> 00:01:42,05
when doing the project,

43
00:01:42,05 --> 00:01:45,05
especially when it makes sense for them work on their own.

44
00:01:45,05 --> 00:01:48,01
Work with them to understand how they work best,

45
00:01:48,01 --> 00:01:51,02
and understand how best they'll work with your team.

46
00:01:51,02 --> 00:01:53,05
And finally, while you may really like

47
00:01:53,05 --> 00:01:56,03
your contractor's work and want to work with them again,

48
00:01:56,03 --> 00:01:59,02
the next time that you need them they may be busier

49
00:01:59,02 --> 00:02:02,06
and not as likely to jump at what you have to offer.

50
00:02:02,06 --> 00:02:06,01
So focus on building some loyalty as soon as you can.

51
00:02:06,01 --> 00:02:07,08
Remember to do the simple things,

52
00:02:07,08 --> 00:02:09,05
like telling them when you like their work,

53
00:02:09,05 --> 00:02:11,04
not just when you want modifications.

54
00:02:11,04 --> 00:02:13,08
And be aware that they don't necessarily

55
00:02:13,08 --> 00:02:16,02
have colleagues to interact with regularly

56
00:02:16,02 --> 00:02:17,04
to the extent that your employees

57
00:02:17,04 --> 00:02:19,06
get to interact with each other.

58
00:02:19,06 --> 00:02:21,04
So if you're all heading out

59
00:02:21,04 --> 00:02:22,04
to a happy hour one day after work

60
00:02:22,04 --> 00:02:25,04
and are going to treat your employees to drinks, by all means,

61
00:02:25,04 --> 00:02:28,06
consider inviting and treating your contractors too.

62
00:02:28,06 --> 00:02:31,01
Always remember that it's often the little things

63
00:02:31,01 --> 00:02:34,01
in your control that can have an out-sized impact,

64
00:02:34,01 --> 00:02:37,03
both in your relationship now and your future relationship

65
00:02:37,03 --> 00:02:40,00
when you need that contractor again.
