1
00:00:01,00 --> 00:00:04,08
- Almost by definition, UX professionals are people centric.

2
00:00:04,08 --> 00:00:06,07
A trait that carries over into the formation

3
00:00:06,07 --> 00:00:09,00
of strong UX meetups and communities

4
00:00:09,00 --> 00:00:11,01
and cities across the globe.

5
00:00:11,01 --> 00:00:13,05
These communities are connected via national

6
00:00:13,05 --> 00:00:16,02
and international UX organizations.

7
00:00:16,02 --> 00:00:18,08
I would encourage you as an employer or recruiter

8
00:00:18,08 --> 00:00:21,06
to become a part of these communities.

9
00:00:21,06 --> 00:00:23,09
Go to meetups in your area and really get

10
00:00:23,09 --> 00:00:26,07
to know those who do UX work.

11
00:00:26,07 --> 00:00:28,06
It should make sense that one of the best ways

12
00:00:28,06 --> 00:00:30,04
to network with people who like people

13
00:00:30,04 --> 00:00:32,05
is to meet them in person.

14
00:00:32,05 --> 00:00:36,03
If possible, do this before you have a need.

15
00:00:36,03 --> 00:00:39,03
Use the opportunity to simply expand your network

16
00:00:39,03 --> 00:00:41,04
as you meet others.

17
00:00:41,04 --> 00:00:43,09
Listen to UX-oriented speakers who

18
00:00:43,09 --> 00:00:46,04
are often featured at in-person events.

19
00:00:46,04 --> 00:00:49,05
And just as important, use these in-person events

20
00:00:49,05 --> 00:00:52,04
to learn the language of UX.

21
00:00:52,04 --> 00:00:56,01
Understand what UX is and what it is not.

22
00:00:56,01 --> 00:00:57,07
Even if you are already acquainted

23
00:00:57,07 --> 00:00:59,07
with the scope of user experience,

24
00:00:59,07 --> 00:01:02,05
there is always something new to learn.

25
00:01:02,05 --> 00:01:04,09
And that something is what is going

26
00:01:04,09 --> 00:01:07,04
to help you not just appear to be an informed

27
00:01:07,04 --> 00:01:10,07
employer or recruiter, but really be one.

28
00:01:10,07 --> 00:01:13,01
As an informed employer or recruiter,

29
00:01:13,01 --> 00:01:15,03
you'll earn respect.

30
00:01:15,03 --> 00:01:17,07
That respect will translate into people coming

31
00:01:17,07 --> 00:01:20,00
to work for you.

32
00:01:20,00 --> 00:01:23,05
Recently, a client asked me to sit in on some interviews.

33
00:01:23,05 --> 00:01:26,04
To help assess the UX research job candidates

34
00:01:26,04 --> 00:01:29,08
who would also be a part of a project I was working on.

35
00:01:29,08 --> 00:01:32,03
One candidate walked in, recognized my name

36
00:01:32,03 --> 00:01:34,06
from my involvement in the wider UX community.

37
00:01:34,06 --> 00:01:37,02
He then accepted the position, saying

38
00:01:37,02 --> 00:01:39,01
that my visibility in the field

39
00:01:39,01 --> 00:01:40,07
and my participation in the interview

40
00:01:40,07 --> 00:01:42,08
as a knowledgeable researcher led

41
00:01:42,08 --> 00:01:46,04
to his trust that this would be a good place to work.

42
00:01:46,04 --> 00:01:48,07
While that was certainly not my nor my client's

43
00:01:48,07 --> 00:01:50,06
reason for my involvement in the interviews,

44
00:01:50,06 --> 00:01:53,06
it does bring home the value of demonstrate-able UX

45
00:01:53,06 --> 00:01:57,06
knowledge and community involvement for hiring success.

46
00:01:57,06 --> 00:01:58,08
That's not to say that meetups

47
00:01:58,08 --> 00:01:59,09
are the only way that you should

48
00:01:59,09 --> 00:02:03,04
become knowledgeable about UX if you aren't already.

49
00:02:03,04 --> 00:02:05,09
I'd encourage you to take some practitioner-oriented

50
00:02:05,09 --> 00:02:10,01
LinkedIn Learning courses to become a little more familiar.

51
00:02:10,01 --> 00:02:12,06
Read UX books and really make sure

52
00:02:12,06 --> 00:02:13,08
that you have a clear

53
00:02:13,08 --> 00:02:17,01
and solid vocabulary and understanding.

54
00:02:17,01 --> 00:02:19,03
This will allow you to construct job recs

55
00:02:19,03 --> 00:02:21,07
that make sense to UX-ers.

56
00:02:21,07 --> 00:02:23,06
You will be more than just a talent seeker

57
00:02:23,06 --> 00:02:25,03
who comes across lacking knowledge

58
00:02:25,03 --> 00:02:27,09
or risks looking uninformed.

59
00:02:27,09 --> 00:02:30,04
You can also go to national UX conferences

60
00:02:30,04 --> 00:02:34,07
that might extend your draw beyond your local geography.

61
00:02:34,07 --> 00:02:38,02
In many cities, UX professionals are in short supply.

62
00:02:38,02 --> 00:02:40,03
These larger conferences will allow you

63
00:02:40,03 --> 00:02:41,06
to expand your reach

64
00:02:41,06 --> 00:02:44,05
to an even wider pool of UX professionals,

65
00:02:44,05 --> 00:02:46,06
while also having the opportunity to attend

66
00:02:46,06 --> 00:02:49,09
a variety of interesting knowledge-expanding sessions.

67
00:02:49,09 --> 00:02:51,04
Want to turn it up a notch?

68
00:02:51,04 --> 00:02:53,02
Be a sponsor.

69
00:02:53,02 --> 00:02:55,03
If you have access to a nice space,

70
00:02:55,03 --> 00:02:56,09
offer to host a meetup.

71
00:02:56,09 --> 00:02:59,04
You can even create a meetup of your own

72
00:02:59,04 --> 00:03:00,09
or sponsor some food.

73
00:03:00,09 --> 00:03:03,02
Offer to supply pizza and drinks.

74
00:03:03,02 --> 00:03:05,09
As a sponsor, you not only get lots

75
00:03:05,09 --> 00:03:07,09
of visibility for your sponsorship,

76
00:03:07,09 --> 00:03:09,09
but meetup organizers will likely give you

77
00:03:09,09 --> 00:03:13,06
the opportunity to talk about upcoming staffing needs too.

78
00:03:13,06 --> 00:03:16,04
At conferences, whether local or not,

79
00:03:16,04 --> 00:03:19,04
you can often rent a booth in the exhibit area.

80
00:03:19,04 --> 00:03:21,06
Add a few intriguing goodies, and you'll find

81
00:03:21,06 --> 00:03:24,01
your talent coming to you.

82
00:03:24,01 --> 00:03:26,08
Additionally, seek to build your UX network

83
00:03:26,08 --> 00:03:29,01
by engaging with people on social media.

84
00:03:29,01 --> 00:03:31,06
Connect with UX professionals and be interesting,

85
00:03:31,06 --> 00:03:33,03
engaging and authentic.

86
00:03:33,03 --> 00:03:35,05
Build your follower base so that when you need

87
00:03:35,05 --> 00:03:38,09
to get the word out about your job offerings, you can.

88
00:03:38,09 --> 00:03:40,09
Sure, you can advertise on social media

89
00:03:40,09 --> 00:03:44,03
as well and certainly do this to whatever level you want.

90
00:03:44,03 --> 00:03:46,03
But also know that having the respect

91
00:03:46,03 --> 00:03:48,07
of a large number of relevant followers

92
00:03:48,07 --> 00:03:51,00
is an advantage in its own right.
