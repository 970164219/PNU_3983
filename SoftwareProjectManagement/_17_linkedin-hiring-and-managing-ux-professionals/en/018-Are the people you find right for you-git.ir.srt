1
00:00:01,04 --> 00:00:03,09
- Once you've identified someone as a potential employee

2
00:00:03,09 --> 00:00:07,02
of your company, or a valuable freelance resource,

3
00:00:07,02 --> 00:00:11,01
how do you figure out if they are really right for you?

4
00:00:11,01 --> 00:00:15,00
Someone that is newer to UX may not have a UX brand yet.

5
00:00:15,00 --> 00:00:17,00
But someone who is coming to you who has experience,

6
00:00:17,00 --> 00:00:19,02
whether an employee or a contractor,

7
00:00:19,02 --> 00:00:23,00
should be self-branded as a UX professional.

8
00:00:23,00 --> 00:00:25,05
First off, does their LinkedIn profile

9
00:00:25,05 --> 00:00:29,07
and their resume articulate a solid set of UX experiences?

10
00:00:29,07 --> 00:00:32,05
And do those experiences tell the story of a UX professional

11
00:00:32,05 --> 00:00:36,00
who does UX activities within the design, research,

12
00:00:36,00 --> 00:00:37,06
and strategy framework?

13
00:00:37,06 --> 00:00:41,04
And without too much time away from UX in the narrative.

14
00:00:41,04 --> 00:00:43,07
If you Google that person, you should ideally

15
00:00:43,07 --> 00:00:45,06
be able to see a UX brand.

16
00:00:45,06 --> 00:00:48,02
Preferably with evidence that they've been associated

17
00:00:48,02 --> 00:00:50,04
with UX activities, have some semblance

18
00:00:50,04 --> 00:00:52,02
of UX represented on social media.

19
00:00:52,02 --> 00:00:56,07
And perhaps have blogged about UX or even spoken at events.

20
00:00:56,07 --> 00:00:58,09
That's not to say that someone who doesn't have a brand

21
00:00:58,09 --> 00:01:01,00
that is steep in UX is wrong for you,

22
00:01:01,00 --> 00:01:03,02
but positive UX branding provides you clues

23
00:01:03,02 --> 00:01:05,09
that this is someone who wants to stay on top of things

24
00:01:05,09 --> 00:01:09,09
and be connected to UX knowledge, ideas, and people.

25
00:01:09,09 --> 00:01:10,09
UX isn't a static field

26
00:01:10,09 --> 00:01:14,07
but doesn't have standardized continue education either.

27
00:01:14,07 --> 00:01:17,00
Look for evidence through what you can gather online

28
00:01:17,00 --> 00:01:18,08
or simply by talking with them

29
00:01:18,08 --> 00:01:20,09
that no matter what the level of experience,

30
00:01:20,09 --> 00:01:23,07
they show an interest in growing and learning.

31
00:01:23,07 --> 00:01:25,07
And that they are excited to try new things

32
00:01:25,07 --> 00:01:29,00
within their respective slice or slices of UX.

33
00:01:29,00 --> 00:01:30,03
When you look at a portfolio,

34
00:01:30,03 --> 00:01:32,01
make sure that you are presented in some way

35
00:01:32,01 --> 00:01:33,09
with a narrative that tells you

36
00:01:33,09 --> 00:01:36,05
that they not only understand the UX framework,

37
00:01:36,05 --> 00:01:39,00
but also specific skills to a level

38
00:01:39,00 --> 00:01:42,03
that matches the target expectations of the position.

39
00:01:42,03 --> 00:01:45,01
If they're describing their portfolio to you in real time,

40
00:01:45,01 --> 00:01:47,04
listen for that narrative as well.

41
00:01:47,04 --> 00:01:49,07
What is the story of their experiences?

42
00:01:49,07 --> 00:01:51,08
How do users fit into the story?

43
00:01:51,08 --> 00:01:55,00
How does their story mesh with your needs?

44
00:01:55,00 --> 00:01:57,06
Finally, remember that UX

45
00:01:57,06 --> 00:02:00,08
does not have a single body of knowledge

46
00:02:00,08 --> 00:02:03,00
or a single set of terminology.

47
00:02:03,00 --> 00:02:05,03
Or, involve a single type of practice

48
00:02:05,03 --> 00:02:08,02
within any particular slice of skills.

49
00:02:08,02 --> 00:02:11,00
So even if someone comes in as an expert,

50
00:02:11,00 --> 00:02:14,01
but is missing one or two of your required experiences,

51
00:02:14,01 --> 00:02:16,02
don't discount them just yet.

52
00:02:16,02 --> 00:02:18,09
If they solidly understand what UX is about,

53
00:02:18,09 --> 00:02:22,02
what they are doing, and who they are doing it for,

54
00:02:22,02 --> 00:02:24,00
the end users, then consider

55
00:02:24,00 --> 00:02:26,01
that one or two missing experiences

56
00:02:26,01 --> 00:02:29,00
can likely be picked up with use.
