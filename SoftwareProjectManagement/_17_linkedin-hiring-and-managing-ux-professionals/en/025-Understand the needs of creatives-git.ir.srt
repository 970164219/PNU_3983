1
00:00:01,00 --> 00:00:03,02
- Let's make a few broad generalizations

2
00:00:03,02 --> 00:00:05,01
about UX professionals.

3
00:00:05,01 --> 00:00:07,04
I believe that many UX professionals,

4
00:00:07,04 --> 00:00:08,08
and I count myself here,

5
00:00:08,08 --> 00:00:11,09
are neither introverts nor extroverts.

6
00:00:11,09 --> 00:00:14,04
Rather, they're somewhere in between.

7
00:00:14,04 --> 00:00:17,01
They're often people who sometimes enjoy the energy

8
00:00:17,01 --> 00:00:18,09
from being and interacting with others,

9
00:00:18,09 --> 00:00:20,06
and then find that they need

10
00:00:20,06 --> 00:00:23,05
to have some time alone to recharge.

11
00:00:23,05 --> 00:00:26,09
Additionally, when you hear UXers declare introversion,

12
00:00:26,09 --> 00:00:28,04
well, it's true they might be.

13
00:00:28,04 --> 00:00:30,07
More often than not, the term introvert

14
00:00:30,07 --> 00:00:33,03
is actually and incorrectly being used

15
00:00:33,03 --> 00:00:35,04
as a synonym for being shy.

16
00:00:35,04 --> 00:00:38,03
And UX professionals are naturally curious.

17
00:00:38,03 --> 00:00:41,02
They seek to gather information, to understand,

18
00:00:41,02 --> 00:00:43,07
and to learn more about the world around them,

19
00:00:43,07 --> 00:00:46,06
and to create for that world.

20
00:00:46,06 --> 00:00:48,05
UX professionals are perhaps a bit more

21
00:00:48,05 --> 00:00:52,01
feeling and emotion-driven than those in other professions.

22
00:00:52,01 --> 00:00:55,02
So, what does that mean for you as an employer?

23
00:00:55,02 --> 00:00:57,01
How do you best manage people

24
00:00:57,01 --> 00:01:00,02
who are neither introverted nor extroverted,

25
00:01:00,02 --> 00:01:02,00
who might sometimes be shy,

26
00:01:02,00 --> 00:01:04,01
but are also curious, creative,

27
00:01:04,01 --> 00:01:06,08
emotional information-seekers?

28
00:01:06,08 --> 00:01:10,01
The physical space you have available isn't going to change,

29
00:01:10,01 --> 00:01:11,00
but no matter what,

30
00:01:11,00 --> 00:01:13,07
you need to have places of collaboration

31
00:01:13,07 --> 00:01:15,07
and places of solitude.

32
00:01:15,07 --> 00:01:18,06
Allow work areas where employees can collaborate

33
00:01:18,06 --> 00:01:20,06
as they passionately discuss how best

34
00:01:20,06 --> 00:01:23,00
to create what your customers want.

35
00:01:23,00 --> 00:01:25,06
And carve out places where employees can retreat to

36
00:01:25,06 --> 00:01:27,08
when they want to work alone.

37
00:01:27,08 --> 00:01:30,02
If you've done what you can to have that quiet space

38
00:01:30,02 --> 00:01:32,02
and you don't think it's good enough,

39
00:01:32,02 --> 00:01:34,09
consider some liberal work-from-home policies

40
00:01:34,09 --> 00:01:36,04
where you also help employees

41
00:01:36,04 --> 00:01:38,08
really create an effective quiet workspace

42
00:01:38,08 --> 00:01:40,04
where they live.

43
00:01:40,04 --> 00:01:42,07
While flexible work arrangements are often best,

44
00:01:42,07 --> 00:01:46,01
do make sure you provide a robust technology infrastructure

45
00:01:46,01 --> 00:01:48,01
to allow staff to communicate effectively

46
00:01:48,01 --> 00:01:50,04
when not in the same place.

47
00:01:50,04 --> 00:01:51,09
If you don't have a permanent office,

48
00:01:51,09 --> 00:01:54,02
consider opportunities to rent low-budget space

49
00:01:54,02 --> 00:01:56,00
in a shared work environment,

50
00:01:56,00 --> 00:01:58,00
somewhere with good coffee, good lighting,

51
00:01:58,00 --> 00:01:59,05
and good restaurants around

52
00:01:59,05 --> 00:02:02,09
so that a team can work together in person when needed.

53
00:02:02,09 --> 00:02:05,06
You can create opportunities for socialization,

54
00:02:05,06 --> 00:02:08,03
and consider providing at least some light structure

55
00:02:08,03 --> 00:02:09,08
some of the time,

56
00:02:09,08 --> 00:02:13,05
such as a non-work activity to mix it up a bit.

57
00:02:13,05 --> 00:02:17,00
And go beyond only providing essential software technology.

58
00:02:17,00 --> 00:02:19,07
If employees learn about a new helpful product

59
00:02:19,07 --> 00:02:21,04
and want to experiment with it,

60
00:02:21,04 --> 00:02:24,02
encourage them to get a trial version, for example.

61
00:02:24,02 --> 00:02:26,03
And encourage that experimentation

62
00:02:26,03 --> 00:02:29,03
with new processes and new methods.

63
00:02:29,03 --> 00:02:32,01
Because UX professionals are focused on people,

64
00:02:32,01 --> 00:02:33,05
they are perhaps more apt

65
00:02:33,05 --> 00:02:35,07
to absorb the emotions of others.

66
00:02:35,07 --> 00:02:38,09
UXers may very well be the first to be affected negatively

67
00:02:38,09 --> 00:02:41,01
by ongoing workplace stress.

68
00:02:41,01 --> 00:02:43,03
Additionally, when you have UX professionals

69
00:02:43,03 --> 00:02:45,05
on the ground interacting with users,

70
00:02:45,05 --> 00:02:47,00
remember that they could be absorbing

71
00:02:47,00 --> 00:02:49,02
those emotions as well.

72
00:02:49,02 --> 00:02:50,03
For six years,

73
00:02:50,03 --> 00:02:53,02
I was doing a lot of research with disaster survivors,

74
00:02:53,02 --> 00:02:54,08
and I remember a few times

75
00:02:54,08 --> 00:02:56,03
when I would be struggling not to cry

76
00:02:56,03 --> 00:02:58,05
when listening to some of their stories.

77
00:02:58,05 --> 00:03:00,09
These interactions impacted me,

78
00:03:00,09 --> 00:03:02,06
not in too serious a way,

79
00:03:02,06 --> 00:03:05,03
but there are other situations where unnecessary empathy

80
00:03:05,03 --> 00:03:07,09
could negatively affect UX staff.

81
00:03:07,09 --> 00:03:09,04
So, be aware of this,

82
00:03:09,04 --> 00:03:13,09
and provide appropriate counterbalances where necessary.

83
00:03:13,09 --> 00:03:16,02
Focus on helping people feel good,

84
00:03:16,02 --> 00:03:17,07
feel good about themselves

85
00:03:17,07 --> 00:03:20,00
and about interactions with others.
