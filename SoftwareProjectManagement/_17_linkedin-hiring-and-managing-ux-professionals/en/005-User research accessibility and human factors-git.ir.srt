00:00:01,00 --> 00:00:02,07
- When it comes to the research bucket,

2
00:00:02,07 --> 00:00:05,02
there are activities that involve research,

3
00:00:05,02 --> 00:00:08,03
that is interactions with and observations of,

4
00:00:08,03 --> 00:00:11,02
actual and representative product users.

5
00:00:11,02 --> 00:00:14,01
And there are activities that involve evaluation,

6
00:00:14,01 --> 00:00:18,03
which compares a product with expected UX best practices.

7
00:00:18,03 --> 00:00:21,03
The most typical job type and skill set to do this work,

8
00:00:21,03 --> 00:00:25,01
is my UX specialty, that of user researcher.

9
00:00:25,01 --> 00:00:26,05
As a user researcher, I've gone

10
00:00:26,05 --> 00:00:28,09
literally all over the United States

11
00:00:28,09 --> 00:00:30,08
and occasionally to other countries

12
00:00:30,08 --> 00:00:34,04
to meet with the right users and understand their needs.

13
00:00:34,04 --> 00:00:36,01
I've met with disaster survivors

14
00:00:36,01 --> 00:00:38,04
after their homes were damaged or destroyed.

15
00:00:38,04 --> 00:00:41,01
I've met with car buyers, tax payers, small business owners,

16
00:00:41,01 --> 00:00:42,07
truckers, sales people.

17
00:00:42,07 --> 00:00:44,00
They all have different needs

18
00:00:44,00 --> 00:00:47,05
and different reactions to technological products.

19
00:00:47,05 --> 00:00:49,07
Understanding those needs and reactions

20
00:00:49,07 --> 00:00:53,02
leads to better offerings that can really help them.

21
00:00:53,02 --> 00:00:55,05
In addition, a research skill set,

22
00:00:55,05 --> 00:00:57,08
which can also be a stand alone career,

23
00:00:57,08 --> 00:01:01,01
is that of an accessibility specialist.

24
00:01:01,01 --> 00:01:03,08
Accessibility is focuses on making sure that products

25
00:01:03,08 --> 00:01:06,07
adhere to international and country specific standards

26
00:01:06,07 --> 00:01:10,04
for universal usability, usable by everyone,

27
00:01:10,04 --> 00:01:12,07
regardless of any disability.

28
00:01:12,07 --> 00:01:13,09
What if someone who was blind

29
00:01:13,09 --> 00:01:16,02
was told they couldn't make online purchases?

30
00:01:16,02 --> 00:01:17,02
What if someone who was deaf

31
00:01:17,02 --> 00:01:19,09
was told they couldn't watch an instructional video?

32
00:01:19,09 --> 00:01:23,05
This is what happens when products are created inaccessibly.

33
00:01:23,05 --> 00:01:26,04
Lastly in the research bucket is human factors.

34
00:01:26,04 --> 00:01:28,04
When I started my career many years ago,

35
00:01:28,04 --> 00:01:31,06
human factors broadly meant what we now call UX.

36
00:01:31,06 --> 00:01:34,02
Today, however, it's used to refer specifically

37
00:01:34,02 --> 00:01:36,01
to research of physical products,

38
00:01:36,01 --> 00:01:38,08
often focused on safety and comfort.

39
00:01:38,08 --> 00:01:41,08
Think about an airplane cockpit or a car.

40
00:01:41,08 --> 00:01:43,04
Now that we've covered design and research,

41
00:01:43,04 --> 00:01:47,00
we have one more big bucket to discuss, strategy.
