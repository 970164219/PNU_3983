1
00:00:01,01 --> 00:00:03,00
- Our third bucket, strategy,

2
00:00:03,00 --> 00:00:05,07
winds its way through both design

3
00:00:05,07 --> 00:00:08,06
and research skillsets and careers.

4
00:00:08,06 --> 00:00:12,08
But strategy has careers and skillsets of its own right.

5
00:00:12,08 --> 00:00:16,00
UX strategy ties business goals

6
00:00:16,00 --> 00:00:19,05
to the use of products by intended users.

7
00:00:19,05 --> 00:00:22,03
Are you able to achieve both happy business owners

8
00:00:22,03 --> 00:00:24,04
and simultaneously happy customers

9
00:00:24,04 --> 00:00:28,07
with products that actually lead to business success?

10
00:00:28,07 --> 00:00:30,07
Then there is content strategy which makes sure

11
00:00:30,07 --> 00:00:32,05
that content and messaging are consistent

12
00:00:32,05 --> 00:00:35,05
in tone and voice across a product.

13
00:00:35,05 --> 00:00:38,00
It is understandable by the intended audience

14
00:00:38,00 --> 00:00:40,05
and align with business goals.

15
00:00:40,05 --> 00:00:42,02
Have you ever found it jarring when going

16
00:00:42,02 --> 00:00:43,08
from one page of a website that informs you

17
00:00:43,08 --> 00:00:46,01
with succinct bits of information

18
00:00:46,01 --> 00:00:49,06
and the next page overwhelms you with wordiness?

19
00:00:49,06 --> 00:00:53,07
Beyond just the interaction, customer experience or CX,

20
00:00:53,07 --> 00:00:56,03
makes sure that there is strategic alignment

21
00:00:56,03 --> 00:00:59,00
between all customer touchpoints in the business,

22
00:00:59,00 --> 00:01:03,06
seeking to improve experience and financial success.

23
00:01:03,06 --> 00:01:04,08
I bet you've seen an email

24
00:01:04,08 --> 00:01:07,02
or text recently asking you likely you are

25
00:01:07,02 --> 00:01:09,02
to recommend a company to a friend.

26
00:01:09,02 --> 00:01:12,00
That's customer experience.
