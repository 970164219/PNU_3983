1
00:00:01,00 --> 00:00:02,04
- There is no one right answer

2
00:00:02,04 --> 00:00:04,05
to whether you should bring on permanent staff

3
00:00:04,05 --> 00:00:07,01
or freelancers or larger businesses.

4
00:00:07,01 --> 00:00:09,01
You may find that your best option

5
00:00:09,01 --> 00:00:13,03
is to mix and match towards business success.

6
00:00:13,03 --> 00:00:14,08
If you are going to mix and match,

7
00:00:14,08 --> 00:00:16,05
it's critical that you have leadership

8
00:00:16,05 --> 00:00:19,03
that really understand the entire UX framework,

9
00:00:19,03 --> 00:00:22,04
and can manage what needs to get accomplished.

10
00:00:22,04 --> 00:00:25,09
These leaders can support both directly and indirectly,

11
00:00:25,09 --> 00:00:28,03
the growth of hires and the integration of those

12
00:00:28,03 --> 00:00:30,08
who are only on board a short time.

13
00:00:30,08 --> 00:00:32,03
Leadership could take the form

14
00:00:32,03 --> 00:00:34,00
of a small business owner,

15
00:00:34,00 --> 00:00:37,00
a project or program manager who has strong UX knowledge,

16
00:00:37,00 --> 00:00:39,06
or a dedicated UX lead.

17
00:00:39,06 --> 00:00:42,04
That leadership position, whatever it may be,

18
00:00:42,04 --> 00:00:45,01
is likely to be a full-time hire itself,

19
00:00:45,01 --> 00:00:47,03
but could also be a contract position,

20
00:00:47,03 --> 00:00:50,09
if for example, it's only of limited duration.

21
00:00:50,09 --> 00:00:54,00
If you're going to hire, pull in novice generalists,

22
00:00:54,00 --> 00:00:56,01
that the UX leadership can shape,

23
00:00:56,01 --> 00:00:58,09
and hire experts who cover some critical areas

24
00:00:58,09 --> 00:01:00,01
that you're going to need,

25
00:01:00,01 --> 00:01:01,09
as well as mentor the novice generalist

26
00:01:01,09 --> 00:01:03,05
in these specific areas.

27
00:01:03,05 --> 00:01:05,02
Now, as needed,

28
00:01:05,02 --> 00:01:07,08
sprinkle in UX freelancers for shorter periods

29
00:01:07,08 --> 00:01:10,02
when work overflows existing bandwidth.

30
00:01:10,02 --> 00:01:13,08
The freelancer should also likely be experts.

31
00:01:13,08 --> 00:01:15,08
If you do hire junior UX staff

32
00:01:15,08 --> 00:01:18,06
and don't have more experienced permanent staff available,

33
00:01:18,06 --> 00:01:21,00
your freelancers can also be contracted

34
00:01:21,00 --> 00:01:23,01
to help mentor the junior staff.

35
00:01:23,01 --> 00:01:26,00
In this way, you are increasing your in-house capabilities

36
00:01:26,00 --> 00:01:27,06
for the future.

37
00:01:27,06 --> 00:01:30,00
I can tell you that as a freelance researcher,

38
00:01:30,00 --> 00:01:32,03
while I love to get repeat business,

39
00:01:32,03 --> 00:01:34,03
it's also really rewarding to be able

40
00:01:34,03 --> 00:01:36,07
to help UX novices grow their skills

41
00:01:36,07 --> 00:01:40,00
and blossom into experts in their own right.

42
00:01:40,00 --> 00:01:41,00
If you have a project

43
00:01:41,00 --> 00:01:44,02
that requires many experts quickly to get the job done,

44
00:01:44,02 --> 00:01:46,08
pull in a larger company to help you.

45
00:01:46,08 --> 00:01:49,07
But again, figure out if there's a way to leverage

46
00:01:49,07 --> 00:01:52,06
that larger company to help grow the skills and knowledge

47
00:01:52,06 --> 00:01:54,08
of your staff along the way.

48
00:01:54,08 --> 00:01:57,01
Ultimately, as your UX needs shift, grow,

49
00:01:57,01 --> 00:01:58,05
and sometimes shrink,

50
00:01:58,05 --> 00:02:01,00
it's going to be a mix of employment types

51
00:02:01,00 --> 00:02:02,09
when you are likely to find the best balance

52
00:02:02,09 --> 00:02:05,00
for business success.
