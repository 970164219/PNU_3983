00:00:01,01 --> 00:00:02,08
- Designed-based jobs in UX

2
00:00:02,08 --> 00:00:05,02
aren't just designed for the sake of beauty,

3
00:00:05,02 --> 00:00:06,09
but designed for the people

4
00:00:06,09 --> 00:00:09,07
that will be interacting with your products.

5
00:00:09,07 --> 00:00:11,01
Most likely you need design

6
00:00:11,01 --> 00:00:14,08
for something that at some point is seen on a screen,

7
00:00:14,08 --> 00:00:18,01
so design is often related to websites or apps,

8
00:00:18,01 --> 00:00:21,00
although can involve wearables and the Internet of Things.

9
00:00:21,00 --> 00:00:23,03
And design can certainly leave the screen as well

10
00:00:23,03 --> 00:00:25,03
for real life interaction with products,

11
00:00:25,03 --> 00:00:28,00
services, and people.

12
00:00:28,00 --> 00:00:30,04
An interaction design career

13
00:00:30,04 --> 00:00:34,00
focuses on how a user interacts with elements on the screen

14
00:00:34,00 --> 00:00:36,06
in order to proceed through the website or app.

15
00:00:36,06 --> 00:00:38,05
Can a user understand what they are seeing

16
00:00:38,05 --> 00:00:39,04
as they use your app

17
00:00:39,04 --> 00:00:42,02
and know how to move onto the next step?

18
00:00:42,02 --> 00:00:45,08
An information architecture career or skillset

19
00:00:45,08 --> 00:00:48,04
centers on the organization of information

20
00:00:48,04 --> 00:00:51,01
that a user interacts with.

21
00:00:51,01 --> 00:00:54,00
That can be both the information that is visible,

22
00:00:54,00 --> 00:00:55,07
and the bits of information behind the scenes

23
00:00:55,07 --> 00:00:58,02
that drive the flow of content.

24
00:00:58,02 --> 00:01:00,06
Think about the options available from a website menu,

25
00:01:00,06 --> 00:01:03,03
or think about how you filter down to a listing

26
00:01:03,03 --> 00:01:05,01
of exactly the product you need

27
00:01:05,01 --> 00:01:08,06
when you're shopping for that perfect little something.

28
00:01:08,06 --> 00:01:13,03
Visual design uses color, imagery, space, and typography

29
00:01:13,03 --> 00:01:15,03
to design in a way that makes sense

30
00:01:15,03 --> 00:01:18,01
and is appreciated by users.

31
00:01:18,01 --> 00:01:20,00
Ever notice when a poor color choice

32
00:01:20,00 --> 00:01:21,06
or an awkwardly-chosen font

33
00:01:21,06 --> 00:01:23,06
causes you to move closer to your phone

34
00:01:23,06 --> 00:01:26,02
to figure out your next step.

35
00:01:26,02 --> 00:01:27,07
Technical communication,

36
00:01:27,07 --> 00:01:30,03
and along with what's more recently referred to

37
00:01:30,03 --> 00:01:31,08
as UX writing

38
00:01:31,08 --> 00:01:35,07
focuses on the design of words throughout the interface.

39
00:01:35,07 --> 00:01:37,09
Those perfect just in time instructions

40
00:01:37,09 --> 00:01:39,03
will make all the difference

41
00:01:39,03 --> 00:01:40,07
when you need to do something complex

42
00:01:40,07 --> 00:01:43,00
like file and pay your taxes.

43
00:01:43,00 --> 00:01:44,04
And service design,

44
00:01:44,04 --> 00:01:47,00
which has an ever-growing prominence around the world,

45
00:01:47,00 --> 00:01:50,01
takes UX beyond the screen into every touchpoint

46
00:01:50,01 --> 00:01:52,01
a customer has with a company.

47
00:01:52,01 --> 00:01:55,02
For example, in person experiences in a brock and mortar

48
00:01:55,02 --> 00:01:57,06
or maybe glass retail outlet.

49
00:01:57,06 --> 00:02:01,00
Or a phone conversation with a call center representative.
