1
00:00:01,00 --> 00:00:02,07
- Something is wrong.

2
00:00:02,07 --> 00:00:04,09
Perhaps the users of your existing product

3
00:00:04,09 --> 00:00:08,06
are complaining on social media about poor usability.

4
00:00:08,06 --> 00:00:11,06
Or maybe you're planning on creating something new

5
00:00:11,06 --> 00:00:14,09
and want to get it right from the start.

6
00:00:14,09 --> 00:00:18,09
Or perhaps you have a robust user experience team already,

7
00:00:18,09 --> 00:00:20,09
but they're the ones who are complaining about

8
00:00:20,09 --> 00:00:23,09
a totally overwhelming workload.

9
00:00:23,09 --> 00:00:27,02
What you need is more user experience firepower.

10
00:00:27,02 --> 00:00:28,07
Now.

11
00:00:28,07 --> 00:00:31,00
Whether you have a UX team already or not,

12
00:00:31,00 --> 00:00:34,05
your business goals may require expanding your capabilities

13
00:00:34,05 --> 00:00:37,01
with additional skills and staff.

14
00:00:37,01 --> 00:00:39,09
If you're trying to figure out what kind of help you need,

15
00:00:39,09 --> 00:00:41,07
what kind of specialties exist

16
00:00:41,07 --> 00:00:43,09
or whether your needs require permanent placement

17
00:00:43,09 --> 00:00:46,01
or limited contracting resources,

18
00:00:46,01 --> 00:00:48,09
we'll go through what you need to know.

19
00:00:48,09 --> 00:00:50,03
I'm Cory Lebson,

20
00:00:50,03 --> 00:00:52,03
author of the UX Careers handbook,

21
00:00:52,03 --> 00:00:57,00
past president of UXPA, and a long time UX practitioner.

22
00:00:57,00 --> 00:00:58,08
Join me on LinkedIn Learning

23
00:00:58,08 --> 00:01:01,03
where we'll talk through all those specialties together,

24
00:01:01,03 --> 00:01:04,00
and explore how you can find the UX support

25
00:01:04,00 --> 00:01:06,00
that you so critically need.
