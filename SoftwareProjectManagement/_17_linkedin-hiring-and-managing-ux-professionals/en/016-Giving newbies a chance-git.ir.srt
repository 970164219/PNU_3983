00:00:01,00 --> 00:00:03,06
- When I've given talks about UX careers in the past,

2
00:00:03,06 --> 00:00:05,09
one of the common frustrations I here about

3
00:00:05,09 --> 00:00:10,00
from those new to UX is the struggle to get their first job.

4
00:00:10,00 --> 00:00:11,05
They don't understand.

5
00:00:11,05 --> 00:00:14,02
If there are so many UX jobs out there,

6
00:00:14,02 --> 00:00:16,01
why are they having trouble getting hired

7
00:00:16,01 --> 00:00:18,08
as a varied junior UX practitioner?

8
00:00:18,08 --> 00:00:20,02
The fundamental problem is

9
00:00:20,02 --> 00:00:22,06
that while there are many UX jobs,

10
00:00:22,06 --> 00:00:24,07
there's also the desire the desire to bring on staff

11
00:00:24,07 --> 00:00:28,00
who have at least some professional UX experience.

12
00:00:28,00 --> 00:00:31,01
If you are pooling in senior-level or contract resources,

13
00:00:31,01 --> 00:00:33,01
you would expect to pay them well.

14
00:00:33,01 --> 00:00:34,00
But you would have people

15
00:00:34,00 --> 00:00:36,03
who can immediately hit the ground running.

16
00:00:36,03 --> 00:00:39,00
However, there is no absolute playbook

17
00:00:39,00 --> 00:00:41,05
on exactly how UX is practiced.

18
00:00:41,05 --> 00:00:43,05
So the way they do their work may be different

19
00:00:43,05 --> 00:00:46,07
than the way your business wants work done.

20
00:00:46,07 --> 00:00:49,06
You have the opportunity to shape UX novices

21
00:00:49,06 --> 00:00:51,09
into professionals that you need.

22
00:00:51,09 --> 00:00:53,05
Yes, you have to be willing

23
00:00:53,05 --> 00:00:55,04
to invest your time and resources,

24
00:00:55,04 --> 00:00:58,09
but you can bring these resources on for a lower cost.

25
00:00:58,09 --> 00:01:01,05
And you'll have staff who can provide needed support to you

26
00:01:01,05 --> 00:01:03,04
and other existing resources,

27
00:01:03,04 --> 00:01:05,00
as these other staff go about doing

28
00:01:05,00 --> 00:01:07,03
their expert-level UX work.

29
00:01:07,03 --> 00:01:08,09
That's not to say they should be starting

30
00:01:08,09 --> 00:01:10,08
completely from scratch.

31
00:01:10,08 --> 00:01:12,05
I'd recommend you'd look for someone

32
00:01:12,05 --> 00:01:15,02
with some type of UX education,

33
00:01:15,02 --> 00:01:18,09
be it from a university, a supplemental business program,

34
00:01:18,09 --> 00:01:20,08
or clear ethnician that they have

35
00:01:20,08 --> 00:01:22,02
really take and the initiative

36
00:01:22,02 --> 00:01:25,08
to learn from LinkedIn Learning or other online resources.

37
00:01:25,08 --> 00:01:27,08
You might be the person that helps them launch

38
00:01:27,08 --> 00:01:29,07
their amazing UX career,

39
00:01:29,07 --> 00:01:32,00
that can supply them with the basic resources

40
00:01:32,00 --> 00:01:34,00
and give them the confidence they need

41
00:01:34,00 --> 00:01:36,05
through appropriate mentoring and training.

42
00:01:36,05 --> 00:01:39,05
In return, you not only get the satisfaction

43
00:01:39,05 --> 00:01:41,02
of helping them be who they were meant to be

44
00:01:41,02 --> 00:01:42,06
as a UX professional,

45
00:01:42,06 --> 00:01:45,04
but you also get a person who you've shaped

46
00:01:45,04 --> 00:01:48,00
to fit your business needs.
