1
00:00:01,00 --> 00:00:02,06
- You may have a UX-oriented project

2
00:00:02,06 --> 00:00:03,08
that needs to get done

3
00:00:03,08 --> 00:00:06,09
but requires more than one person.

4
00:00:06,09 --> 00:00:09,04
In fact, the project can require a whole team

5
00:00:09,04 --> 00:00:12,09
of people complete with someone to manage that team.

6
00:00:12,09 --> 00:00:15,03
Agencies are likely more expensive

7
00:00:15,03 --> 00:00:17,07
than hiring individual freelancers

8
00:00:17,07 --> 00:00:20,07
but when you need a lot of UX expertise quickly,

9
00:00:20,07 --> 00:00:23,00
hiring a larger agency or consulting firm

10
00:00:23,00 --> 00:00:24,08
gives you that option.

11
00:00:24,08 --> 00:00:27,07
Working with agencies can be more complex,

12
00:00:27,07 --> 00:00:29,02
at at the beginning

13
00:00:29,02 --> 00:00:31,08
and you're also likely to have the least control

14
00:00:31,08 --> 00:00:34,02
over the process.

15
00:00:34,02 --> 00:00:36,03
Agencies have to balance their projects

16
00:00:36,03 --> 00:00:37,09
with all their clients,

17
00:00:37,09 --> 00:00:40,07
with some staff dedicated to you for the duration

18
00:00:40,07 --> 00:00:42,07
but other who only come and go based

19
00:00:42,07 --> 00:00:45,00
on their other responsibilities.

20
00:00:45,00 --> 00:00:47,07
An agency could supply the whole UX project team,

21
00:00:47,07 --> 00:00:49,04
all with expert skills

22
00:00:49,04 --> 00:00:52,01
inclusive of research, design and strategy

23
00:00:52,01 --> 00:00:53,03
in a more reliable way

24
00:00:53,03 --> 00:00:54,05
than you may be able to find

25
00:00:54,05 --> 00:00:56,05
when only trying to pull in a freelancer

26
00:00:56,05 --> 00:00:59,03
or when hiring a single employee.

27
00:00:59,03 --> 00:01:01,06
Bringing on agencies and larger consulting firms,

28
00:01:01,06 --> 00:01:05,03
however, introduces a different set of processes

29
00:01:05,03 --> 00:01:08,00
than bringing individuals in any context.

30
00:01:08,00 --> 00:01:09,09
In a while, we'll talk about RFPs

31
00:01:09,09 --> 00:01:12,00
or request for proposals

32
00:01:12,00 --> 00:01:14,02
and why these are better suited for businesses

33
00:01:14,02 --> 00:01:17,04
that are big enough to handle regular proposal writing.

34
00:01:17,04 --> 00:01:19,08
These larger businesses also provide you

35
00:01:19,08 --> 00:01:23,03
with another option, staff augmentation.

36
00:01:23,03 --> 00:01:26,02
Staff augmentation means you can get a person full time

37
00:01:26,02 --> 00:01:28,01
for a long duration

38
00:01:28,01 --> 00:01:29,07
such that they seem to be no different

39
00:01:29,07 --> 00:01:31,04
than an employee of yours

40
00:01:31,04 --> 00:01:33,09
except that you pay another company

41
00:01:33,09 --> 00:01:37,03
and that company pays the individual.

42
00:01:37,03 --> 00:01:38,09
Whereas freelance contractors

43
00:01:38,09 --> 00:01:40,08
are often hired per project,

44
00:01:40,08 --> 00:01:44,02
staff augmentation can be much longer term than that

45
00:01:44,02 --> 00:01:47,06
just like you would hire an employee for the long term.

46
00:01:47,06 --> 00:01:49,04
When UX talent is hard to find,

47
00:01:49,04 --> 00:01:51,09
staff augmentation basically takes

48
00:01:51,09 --> 00:01:53,09
this responsibility off your plate

49
00:01:53,09 --> 00:01:55,04
and lets someone else find you

50
00:01:55,04 --> 00:01:59,06
who you need and they take responsibility for them

51
00:01:59,06 --> 00:02:03,00
but stick with staff augmentation from a larger business.

52
00:02:03,00 --> 00:02:04,08
Taking on an individual freelancer

53
00:02:04,08 --> 00:02:06,03
for staff augmentation

54
00:02:06,03 --> 00:02:08,07
could put you on the wrong side of the law.

55
00:02:08,07 --> 00:02:10,02
Here in the United States,

56
00:02:10,02 --> 00:02:12,00
the IRS has a number of tests

57
00:02:12,00 --> 00:02:13,07
for businesses in terms of the level

58
00:02:13,07 --> 00:02:15,07
of behavioral and financial control

59
00:02:15,07 --> 00:02:18,07
that a business has over an individual.

60
00:02:18,07 --> 00:02:21,02
The IRS also looks for justification

61
00:02:21,02 --> 00:02:24,01
that the individual is acting as a business

62
00:02:24,01 --> 00:02:27,06
that promotes services with a certain level of autonomy.

63
00:02:27,06 --> 00:02:28,07
While I'm not a lawyer

64
00:02:28,07 --> 00:02:30,06
and in no way giving you legal advice,

65
00:02:30,06 --> 00:02:33,05
I would say that pulling an individual freelancer

66
00:02:33,05 --> 00:02:35,07
into a staff augmentation role

67
00:02:35,07 --> 00:02:38,04
may be harder to justify against the criteria

68
00:02:38,04 --> 00:02:41,01
of what constitutes an employee.

69
00:02:41,01 --> 00:02:43,06
However, using a larger agency,

70
00:02:43,06 --> 00:02:45,06
particularly one that is essentially set up

71
00:02:45,06 --> 00:02:47,03
to provide UX temps for a short

72
00:02:47,03 --> 00:02:50,02
or long duration may be your best bet

73
00:02:50,02 --> 00:02:52,07
when you truly don't want to hire an employee

74
00:02:52,07 --> 00:02:55,06
but need a person full time for a longer duration

75
00:02:55,06 --> 00:03:00,00
and rest assured that those types of companies do exist.

76
00:03:00,00 --> 00:03:01,08
Now you're ready to find someone,

77
00:03:01,08 --> 00:03:04,06
so let's consider whether you need a generalist

78
00:03:04,06 --> 00:03:06,00
or an expert.
