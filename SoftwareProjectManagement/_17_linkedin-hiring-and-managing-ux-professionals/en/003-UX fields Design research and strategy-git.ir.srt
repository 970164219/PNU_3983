00:00:01,00 --> 00:00:03,05
- Whether you're bringing on full-time permanent staff

2
00:00:03,05 --> 00:00:07,03
or finding an individual or a company with short-term needs,

3
00:00:07,03 --> 00:00:10,00
you need to pause for a moment and become familiar

4
00:00:10,00 --> 00:00:12,07
with the variety of UX jobs and skillsets,

5
00:00:12,07 --> 00:00:15,04
so that you can get exactly the professionals you need

6
00:00:15,04 --> 00:00:19,01
to lead your products to business success.

7
00:00:19,01 --> 00:00:21,09
I'll start by saying that this variety of jobs and skillsets

8
00:00:21,09 --> 00:00:24,02
fall primarily into three buckets.

9
00:00:24,02 --> 00:00:26,01
Those involve design.

10
00:00:26,01 --> 00:00:27,08
Those involve research.

11
00:00:27,08 --> 00:00:30,05
And those involve strategy.

12
00:00:30,05 --> 00:00:33,01
It would be most simple if every type of UX job

13
00:00:33,01 --> 00:00:36,00
fell purely into one of these three buckets.

14
00:00:36,00 --> 00:00:38,04
While admittedly this is not the case,

15
00:00:38,04 --> 00:00:41,00
it's still possible to generally group skillsets

16
00:00:41,00 --> 00:00:43,01
you may need for your team.

17
00:00:43,01 --> 00:00:47,00
Let's now take a quick dive into these three skillsets.
