1
00:00:01,01 --> 00:00:03,00
- Posting a position to job boards

2
00:00:03,00 --> 00:00:05,06
can be great for pulling in full-time hires,

3
00:00:05,06 --> 00:00:08,03
and can be useful for temporary work, too.

4
00:00:08,03 --> 00:00:10,06
But there are other good ways to get visibility

5
00:00:10,06 --> 00:00:12,02
when seeking UX contractors,

6
00:00:12,02 --> 00:00:15,00
and especially creative agencies.

7
00:00:15,00 --> 00:00:16,03
As we discussed earlier,

8
00:00:16,03 --> 00:00:19,00
you should try to become a part of the UX community

9
00:00:19,00 --> 00:00:20,09
by participating in UX events

10
00:00:20,09 --> 00:00:22,09
and being part of social media.

11
00:00:22,09 --> 00:00:24,05
This builds you direct access

12
00:00:24,05 --> 00:00:27,02
to potential future job candidates.

13
00:00:27,02 --> 00:00:30,00
In addition, having a ready pool of freelancers

14
00:00:30,00 --> 00:00:31,04
in advance of your needs,

15
00:00:31,04 --> 00:00:33,03
particularly those who don't usually get booked

16
00:00:33,03 --> 00:00:35,03
on full-time, long-term engagements,

17
00:00:35,03 --> 00:00:37,04
is very valuable.

18
00:00:37,04 --> 00:00:39,03
How do companies find me?

19
00:00:39,03 --> 00:00:41,07
Largely, they find me for smaller projects

20
00:00:41,07 --> 00:00:43,03
through ad hoc methods,

21
00:00:43,03 --> 00:00:44,05
such as being referred by those

22
00:00:44,05 --> 00:00:47,06
that already know and have worked with me.

23
00:00:47,06 --> 00:00:49,05
Sometimes they find me on LinkedIn,

24
00:00:49,05 --> 00:00:52,08
presumably with a keyword search for research freelancers.

25
00:00:52,08 --> 00:00:55,04
Sometimes I get contacted directly through LinkedIn,

26
00:00:55,04 --> 00:00:58,08
Twitter, or Facebook by existing connections.

27
00:00:58,08 --> 00:01:00,05
By and large as a freelancer,

28
00:01:00,05 --> 00:01:02,08
I've found companies have a lot of success booking me

29
00:01:02,08 --> 00:01:04,02
through these methods,

30
00:01:04,02 --> 00:01:07,00
as well as finding other freelancer types.

31
00:01:07,00 --> 00:01:09,01
Knowing agencies with larger talent pools

32
00:01:09,01 --> 00:01:10,09
that they can assign to projects as needed

33
00:01:10,09 --> 00:01:13,04
is certainly great for future planning, too,

34
00:01:13,04 --> 00:01:16,04
especially when urgent needs present themselves.

35
00:01:16,04 --> 00:01:19,02
For larger projects, however you want to define that,

36
00:01:19,02 --> 00:01:21,08
you may want to consider more formal methods

37
00:01:21,08 --> 00:01:23,03
of securing talent.

38
00:01:23,03 --> 00:01:26,06
In these cases, you may consider seeking out UX contractors

39
00:01:26,06 --> 00:01:30,04
with an RFP, or request for proposals.

40
00:01:30,04 --> 00:01:31,05
Every now and again,

41
00:01:31,05 --> 00:01:32,07
I get a request from a business

42
00:01:32,07 --> 00:01:34,05
that goes something like this.

43
00:01:34,05 --> 00:01:37,00
"We've heard great things about your user research efforts.

44
00:01:37,00 --> 00:01:38,08
"We'd like to consider engaging you.

45
00:01:38,08 --> 00:01:40,07
"Just complete a response to our proposal,

46
00:01:40,07 --> 00:01:42,06
"and we'll consider you."

47
00:01:42,06 --> 00:01:43,09
The problem I find is that

48
00:01:43,09 --> 00:01:46,03
if I'm heavily involved in another project at the time,

49
00:01:46,03 --> 00:01:48,03
such as a usability study,

50
00:01:48,03 --> 00:01:49,06
I don't have the time needed

51
00:01:49,06 --> 00:01:52,03
to give a proper response to the proposal.

52
00:01:52,03 --> 00:01:55,04
I often end up declining to respond for lack of time,

53
00:01:55,04 --> 00:01:57,01
or passing it on to a larger business

54
00:01:57,01 --> 00:01:58,04
and letting them know I'm happy

55
00:01:58,04 --> 00:02:00,09
to be part of the project if they'd like.

56
00:02:00,09 --> 00:02:01,09
So on the one hand,

57
00:02:01,09 --> 00:02:04,05
RFPs are a great way to get UX-oriented companies

58
00:02:04,05 --> 00:02:06,00
to bid on an engagement,

59
00:02:06,00 --> 00:02:07,09
so that you can get an apples-to-apples comparison

60
00:02:07,09 --> 00:02:11,03
on methods, staffing, and pricing.

61
00:02:11,03 --> 00:02:12,03
On the other hand,

62
00:02:12,03 --> 00:02:14,05
you may be limiting yourself to bigger businesses

63
00:02:14,05 --> 00:02:16,00
with the dedicated staff needed

64
00:02:16,00 --> 00:02:19,01
to regularly respond to RFPs.

65
00:02:19,01 --> 00:02:21,04
I'm not saying that you shouldn't use RFPs,

66
00:02:21,04 --> 00:02:23,00
simply that they're better suited

67
00:02:23,00 --> 00:02:24,08
to target larger businesses

68
00:02:24,08 --> 00:02:28,00
that can spend time properly responding to them.

69
00:02:28,00 --> 00:02:32,00
Finally, consider your options when you post job listings.

70
00:02:32,00 --> 00:02:33,09
You can post for full-time jobs,

71
00:02:33,09 --> 00:02:37,06
but you can also post short-term and contract roles.

72
00:02:37,06 --> 00:02:39,09
LinkedIn is a great resource for these postings,

73
00:02:39,09 --> 00:02:41,02
as well as Indeed

74
00:02:41,02 --> 00:02:44,05
and a number of other general hiring sites.

75
00:02:44,05 --> 00:02:47,00
There are UX-specific job boards as well.

76
00:02:47,00 --> 00:02:50,08
Sites like UX Job Board, UX Jobs 24/7, and more.

77
00:02:50,08 --> 00:02:54,02
You can get a longer list on my UX Careers Handbook website.

78
00:02:54,02 --> 00:02:55,06
The advantage of these sites

79
00:02:55,06 --> 00:02:58,00
is that they are all UX, all the time,

80
00:02:58,00 --> 00:03:00,07
and they attract UX freelancers, too.

81
00:03:00,07 --> 00:03:02,03
The downside is that even though

82
00:03:02,03 --> 00:03:04,01
they get the right kind of traffic,

83
00:03:04,01 --> 00:03:06,08
they're usually non-locally targeted.

84
00:03:06,08 --> 00:03:08,07
The less frequent fresh job postings

85
00:03:08,07 --> 00:03:11,04
also mean that those freelancers and contractors

86
00:03:11,04 --> 00:03:13,09
aren't necessarily checking in too regularly

87
00:03:13,09 --> 00:03:16,00
when they're hungry for work.
