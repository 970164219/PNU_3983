1
00:00:01,00 --> 00:00:03,06
- At some point, you're going to want to post a job,

2
00:00:03,06 --> 00:00:06,05
a title that encourages prospects to read further

3
00:00:06,05 --> 00:00:08,09
along with an enticing job description.

4
00:00:08,09 --> 00:00:10,09
Clearly, the title and job description

5
00:00:10,09 --> 00:00:14,03
are critical pieces of finding the employees that you need.

6
00:00:14,03 --> 00:00:15,05
And truth be told,

7
00:00:15,05 --> 00:00:18,08
it's not necessarily just employees that you're posting for.

8
00:00:18,08 --> 00:00:22,03
You can post for temporary talent, too.

9
00:00:22,03 --> 00:00:25,00
Before we get into the specifics of the job posting,

10
00:00:25,00 --> 00:00:28,03
it's important to figure out what you really want.

11
00:00:28,03 --> 00:00:30,03
Earlier, we talked at a high level

12
00:00:30,03 --> 00:00:32,09
about the varying types of UX jobs and skill sets

13
00:00:32,09 --> 00:00:36,02
clustered into design, research, and strategy.

14
00:00:36,02 --> 00:00:38,09
You shouldn't try to get it all in one person,

15
00:00:38,09 --> 00:00:42,09
particularly if you are looking for a level of expertise.

16
00:00:42,09 --> 00:00:45,08
Instead, focus on your core needs,

17
00:00:45,08 --> 00:00:48,06
the UX superpowers that you are really looking for,

18
00:00:48,06 --> 00:00:51,02
along with those UX skills which would be nice to have,

19
00:00:51,02 --> 00:00:53,02
but aren't critical.

20
00:00:53,02 --> 00:00:55,00
Let's start with the title.

21
00:00:55,00 --> 00:00:57,07
If your primary skill set is interaction design,

22
00:00:57,07 --> 00:01:02,00
then title your job interaction designer or UX designer.

23
00:01:02,00 --> 00:01:03,09
If it's critical to you that you get someone

24
00:01:03,09 --> 00:01:07,01
with both interaction design and research skills,

25
00:01:07,01 --> 00:01:10,05
then you can use interaction designer/user researcher,

26
00:01:10,05 --> 00:01:13,04
or UX designer/researcher.

27
00:01:13,04 --> 00:01:15,02
Beware of going too generic.

28
00:01:15,02 --> 00:01:18,04
You may think that user experience specialist

29
00:01:18,04 --> 00:01:19,08
gives you the Big 10,

30
00:01:19,08 --> 00:01:21,09
but it doesn't tell potential applicants

31
00:01:21,09 --> 00:01:24,07
what kind of skill sets you're looking for.

32
00:01:24,07 --> 00:01:27,04
Also, if you want a UX professional,

33
00:01:27,04 --> 00:01:31,00
please avoid calling the job UX/UI.

34
00:01:31,00 --> 00:01:33,07
The UI part muddies the waters.

35
00:01:33,07 --> 00:01:37,00
Sometimes it's used to indicate visual design skills.

36
00:01:37,00 --> 00:01:37,08
Other times,

37
00:01:37,08 --> 00:01:39,07
it can mean that you're actually looking for someone

38
00:01:39,07 --> 00:01:41,08
with front-end developer skills.

39
00:01:41,08 --> 00:01:45,02
In short, if you call a job UX/UI,

40
00:01:45,02 --> 00:01:46,05
it could look to a job seeker

41
00:01:46,05 --> 00:01:49,09
that you don't know what you're looking for.

42
00:01:49,09 --> 00:01:52,05
I understand that you may have a limited budget,

43
00:01:52,05 --> 00:01:55,04
but again, don't try to get UX expertise

44
00:01:55,04 --> 00:01:58,07
and development expertise in the same person.

45
00:01:58,07 --> 00:02:01,04
You can get solid development and some UX,

46
00:02:01,04 --> 00:02:03,08
or solid UX and some development,

47
00:02:03,08 --> 00:02:07,03
but truly getting expertise in both is difficult.

48
00:02:07,03 --> 00:02:10,00
Seeing coding expertise in a job title or description

49
00:02:10,00 --> 00:02:12,00
will frighten off a lot of potential applicants

50
00:02:12,00 --> 00:02:15,06
who do have the appropriate UX expertise.

51
00:02:15,06 --> 00:02:18,09
You also need to specify a level of seniority.

52
00:02:18,09 --> 00:02:22,05
Feel free to use terms like junior, mid-level, or senior,

53
00:02:22,05 --> 00:02:24,06
but keep in mind that these terms

54
00:02:24,06 --> 00:02:27,01
don't mean the same thing to everyone.

55
00:02:27,01 --> 00:02:28,08
Many people would agree that titles

56
00:02:28,08 --> 00:02:31,06
like director and principal or even vice president

57
00:02:31,06 --> 00:02:32,09
are above senior,

58
00:02:32,09 --> 00:02:36,05
but again, those terms don't have a single definition.

59
00:02:36,05 --> 00:02:38,01
And no matter what,

60
00:02:38,01 --> 00:02:39,08
don't use internal classification

61
00:02:39,08 --> 00:02:42,07
to designate seniority on a public job posting.

62
00:02:42,07 --> 00:02:44,06
I recently got an email from a recruiter

63
00:02:44,06 --> 00:02:47,03
that tacked on the number four to the job title,

64
00:02:47,03 --> 00:02:49,06
as if I'm supposed to know what kind of seniority

65
00:02:49,06 --> 00:02:53,01
is implied from a UX designer four.

66
00:02:53,01 --> 00:02:55,06
Now let's think about the job description.

67
00:02:55,06 --> 00:02:58,01
Keep your critical skills as narrow as you can

68
00:02:58,01 --> 00:02:59,04
within that UX umbrella,

69
00:02:59,04 --> 00:03:03,06
and then expand in a follow-up nice-to-have section.

70
00:03:03,06 --> 00:03:05,05
But even that nice-to-have section

71
00:03:05,05 --> 00:03:07,09
shouldn't expand too wide,

72
00:03:07,09 --> 00:03:09,03
or it may look like you're looking

73
00:03:09,03 --> 00:03:11,05
for that elusive UX unicorn,

74
00:03:11,05 --> 00:03:15,03
that magical creature who's an expert in everything.

75
00:03:15,03 --> 00:03:19,00
It's a big turnoff to experienced job-seekers.

76
00:03:19,00 --> 00:03:22,02
Your description needs to be specific about job functions.

77
00:03:22,02 --> 00:03:24,03
Feel free to mention tools you use.

78
00:03:24,03 --> 00:03:27,06
For example, a design team may already be using InVision

79
00:03:27,06 --> 00:03:29,04
or the various Adobe products.

80
00:03:29,04 --> 00:03:33,04
But be cautious about requiring specific software expertise,

81
00:03:33,04 --> 00:03:34,07
which can be an instant turnoff

82
00:03:34,07 --> 00:03:36,02
to a very experienced professional

83
00:03:36,02 --> 00:03:38,02
who hasn't interacted with a piece of software

84
00:03:38,02 --> 00:03:41,01
but has lots of experience on similar tools.

85
00:03:41,01 --> 00:03:43,02
It's much easier to translate knowledge

86
00:03:43,02 --> 00:03:44,07
between software products

87
00:03:44,07 --> 00:03:48,04
than it is to learn new software concepts from scratch.

88
00:03:48,04 --> 00:03:51,04
If you have headcount for two UX professionals,

89
00:03:51,04 --> 00:03:53,07
consider the possibility that you may find

90
00:03:53,07 --> 00:03:56,04
one person with some of the necessary UX skills

91
00:03:56,04 --> 00:03:59,06
and another person with the other UX skills,

92
00:03:59,06 --> 00:04:01,07
so keep your descriptions open enough

93
00:04:01,07 --> 00:04:04,01
that you can leave yourself flexibility

94
00:04:04,01 --> 00:04:05,05
to work with whomever happens

95
00:04:05,05 --> 00:04:07,05
to be in a job market at that time.

96
00:04:07,05 --> 00:04:10,02
Also, feel free to mention that you are looking

97
00:04:10,02 --> 00:04:12,08
for specialists with a subset of areas of expertise

98
00:04:12,08 --> 00:04:14,02
for your master list,

99
00:04:14,02 --> 00:04:16,08
and make it clear that these areas of expertise

100
00:04:16,08 --> 00:04:20,02
may be covered over multiple hires.

101
00:04:20,02 --> 00:04:22,05
Oh, just one more thing.

102
00:04:22,05 --> 00:04:25,01
There are a handful of certifications out there,

103
00:04:25,01 --> 00:04:26,08
so which one do you request

104
00:04:26,08 --> 00:04:29,00
when you post your job description?

105
00:04:29,00 --> 00:04:32,05
I will strongly and emphatically say none.

106
00:04:32,05 --> 00:04:36,06
Do not require or even prefer a certification.

107
00:04:36,06 --> 00:04:38,07
Certification of UX professionals,

108
00:04:38,07 --> 00:04:40,08
when there are widely diverse skill sets

109
00:04:40,08 --> 00:04:42,03
and no single definition

110
00:04:42,03 --> 00:04:44,05
of what it means to be a UX professional,

111
00:04:44,05 --> 00:04:47,00
is highly controversial.

112
00:04:47,00 --> 00:04:49,05
Don't even suggest that this matters to you.

113
00:04:49,05 --> 00:04:52,00
Instead, focus on asking for a level

114
00:04:52,00 --> 00:04:53,08
of UX knowledge and expertise

115
00:04:53,08 --> 00:04:58,00
that match the seniority and expertise required of the role.
