1
00:00:01,00 --> 00:00:03,03
- It's fair to expect that a new contract resource

2
00:00:03,03 --> 00:00:04,08
can hit the ground running,

3
00:00:04,08 --> 00:00:08,02
but be aware that every organization or even work group

4
00:00:08,02 --> 00:00:11,06
likely has an established unique UX culture

5
00:00:11,06 --> 00:00:13,06
and corporate culture.

6
00:00:13,06 --> 00:00:16,05
The contractor isn't going to be familiar with that culture

7
00:00:16,05 --> 00:00:19,00
and may need to align themselves.

8
00:00:19,00 --> 00:00:22,00
Corporate UX employees may share a common body of knowledge

9
00:00:22,00 --> 00:00:24,01
that combines typical UX practice

10
00:00:24,01 --> 00:00:26,09
with industry and corporate influences.

11
00:00:26,09 --> 00:00:29,08
Expect your new UX resource to understand and respond

12
00:00:29,08 --> 00:00:31,08
to a typical UX framework.

13
00:00:31,08 --> 00:00:34,05
But when that's combined with an additional unique framework

14
00:00:34,05 --> 00:00:36,04
of your company or industry,

15
00:00:36,04 --> 00:00:39,08
you'll have to provide some additional context.

16
00:00:39,08 --> 00:00:42,09
You'll need to define terms that you use differently.

17
00:00:42,09 --> 00:00:45,06
For example, a client recently told me

18
00:00:45,06 --> 00:00:48,01
that they were going to do both user research

19
00:00:48,01 --> 00:00:50,05
and usability testing.

20
00:00:50,05 --> 00:00:52,07
Since I would typically consider user research

21
00:00:52,07 --> 00:00:54,05
as an umbrella of methods,

22
00:00:54,05 --> 00:00:57,04
and usability testing as one such method,

23
00:00:57,04 --> 00:01:00,05
I asked the client for further clarification

24
00:01:00,05 --> 00:01:03,07
so that I would better understand what he was expecting.

25
00:01:03,07 --> 00:01:06,07
It turns out that he was framing user research

26
00:01:06,07 --> 00:01:08,03
as more ethnographic,

27
00:01:08,03 --> 00:01:10,09
and oriented at requirements gathering,

28
00:01:10,09 --> 00:01:13,04
what I might call contextual inquiry,

29
00:01:13,04 --> 00:01:15,00
while usability testing

30
00:01:15,00 --> 00:01:18,01
was a more formal task-based assessment.

31
00:01:18,01 --> 00:01:20,02
Once we agreed on our definitions,

32
00:01:20,02 --> 00:01:23,00
the conversation continued smoothly.

33
00:01:23,00 --> 00:01:26,00
Also, don't be surprised if your new resource

34
00:01:26,00 --> 00:01:27,06
comes with some preconceived ideas

35
00:01:27,06 --> 00:01:29,07
about the way that things should be done

36
00:01:29,07 --> 00:01:32,08
or how to conduct specific UX activities.

37
00:01:32,08 --> 00:01:34,09
While you certainly have the last word,

38
00:01:34,09 --> 00:01:36,09
do consider that contract resources

39
00:01:36,09 --> 00:01:39,09
can provide you with some cross-pollination,

40
00:01:39,09 --> 00:01:41,05
taking their best experiences

41
00:01:41,05 --> 00:01:43,05
from other companies and projects

42
00:01:43,05 --> 00:01:46,04
and bringing these approaches to you.

43
00:01:46,04 --> 00:01:48,07
Do your best not to squash these opportunities

44
00:01:48,07 --> 00:01:51,03
for innovation by micromanaging.

45
00:01:51,03 --> 00:01:54,06
You'll likely find value in the varied, innovative ideas

46
00:01:54,06 --> 00:01:57,00
that they can bring to you and your company.
