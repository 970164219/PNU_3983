1
00:00:01,00 --> 00:00:04,00
- You may worry about bringing on agencies and freelancers

2
00:00:04,00 --> 00:00:05,07
who are less in your control,

3
00:00:05,07 --> 00:00:07,02
and who provide greater risk

4
00:00:07,02 --> 00:00:09,07
and potentially more variability in your management

5
00:00:09,07 --> 00:00:12,06
of the project timeline, scope, and budget.

6
00:00:12,06 --> 00:00:15,01
The key is communication.

7
00:00:15,01 --> 00:00:16,07
As soon as you possibly can,

8
00:00:16,07 --> 00:00:19,04
ideally while you're still scoping out the effort,

9
00:00:19,04 --> 00:00:21,09
work with your designated contractor to figure out

10
00:00:21,09 --> 00:00:23,08
what their expectations may be,

11
00:00:23,08 --> 00:00:25,06
and how these expectations align

12
00:00:25,06 --> 00:00:27,07
with what you see yourself needing.

13
00:00:27,07 --> 00:00:30,00
Different UX activities take different amounts of time

14
00:00:30,00 --> 00:00:31,06
for different people.

15
00:00:31,06 --> 00:00:34,02
However, in a time and materials contract,

16
00:00:34,02 --> 00:00:37,09
meaning you pay people by the hour or perhaps by the day,

17
00:00:37,09 --> 00:00:40,04
you certainly do have the right to tell contractors

18
00:00:40,04 --> 00:00:44,00
that they need to fit within a certain set of hours or days.

19
00:00:44,00 --> 00:00:46,01
If they have concerns they can discuss these with you

20
00:00:46,01 --> 00:00:47,06
at that point.

21
00:00:47,06 --> 00:00:50,00
But if they do propose more hours than you want

22
00:00:50,00 --> 00:00:52,00
and you successfully talk them down,

23
00:00:52,00 --> 00:00:54,05
still make sure to assess whether they plan to do this

24
00:00:54,05 --> 00:00:56,02
in a way that could risk compromising

25
00:00:56,02 --> 00:00:59,03
the quality of the UX work that you are planning.

26
00:00:59,03 --> 00:01:01,07
Conversely, you don't want to over budget

27
00:01:01,07 --> 00:01:03,03
significantly on their time,

28
00:01:03,03 --> 00:01:04,07
particularly if this forces you

29
00:01:04,07 --> 00:01:06,02
not to spend enough elsewhere

30
00:01:06,02 --> 00:01:08,05
in order to stick to your project budget.

31
00:01:08,05 --> 00:01:11,02
If you want to propose a fixed price contract

32
00:01:11,02 --> 00:01:14,04
drill down very precisely to what is required,

33
00:01:14,04 --> 00:01:16,01
and allow for extra buffer time

34
00:01:16,01 --> 00:01:19,04
so that the contractor doesn't feel taken advantage of.

35
00:01:19,04 --> 00:01:22,02
For example, when a client wants to give me

36
00:01:22,02 --> 00:01:24,05
a fixed price to do a usability test,

37
00:01:24,05 --> 00:01:27,07
I want to nail down little details to fully understand

38
00:01:27,07 --> 00:01:29,05
the prep work required.

39
00:01:29,05 --> 00:01:32,01
I seek to understand the amount of effort

40
00:01:32,01 --> 00:01:34,06
I'll need to learn the system,

41
00:01:34,06 --> 00:01:37,03
the maximum number of participants,

42
00:01:37,03 --> 00:01:39,05
the number of days of testing,

43
00:01:39,05 --> 00:01:42,01
whether it's a remote study, locally in-person,

44
00:01:42,01 --> 00:01:44,06
or requires out-of-town travel,

45
00:01:44,06 --> 00:01:48,01
the session length, and recruiting approach.

46
00:01:48,01 --> 00:01:50,06
I also ask about the type of reporting and due date

47
00:01:50,06 --> 00:01:52,05
for any reporting deliverables,

48
00:01:52,05 --> 00:01:54,03
as well as what is expected of me

49
00:01:54,03 --> 00:01:56,09
after the reports are delivered.

50
00:01:56,09 --> 00:01:58,03
Once I know all these details,

51
00:01:58,03 --> 00:02:01,07
I'll typically feel comfortable giving a fixed price quote.

52
00:02:01,07 --> 00:02:03,04
Don't worry if you don't feel comfortable

53
00:02:03,04 --> 00:02:06,02
with all the details enough to scope it out yourself.

54
00:02:06,02 --> 00:02:08,00
You can certainly leverage the knowledge

55
00:02:08,00 --> 00:02:11,03
of your selected resource to help you.

56
00:02:11,03 --> 00:02:13,09
Even if you aren't drafting the contract yourself,

57
00:02:13,09 --> 00:02:16,05
you may also find yourself in the position of negotiator

58
00:02:16,05 --> 00:02:18,03
with your contracting office.

59
00:02:18,03 --> 00:02:21,04
Again, don't hesitate to reach out to your new resource

60
00:02:21,04 --> 00:02:23,05
and have them review and if necessary

61
00:02:23,05 --> 00:02:27,09
redline early contract drafts to avoid surprises later on.

62
00:02:27,09 --> 00:02:31,04
On the flip side, there's a dynamic nature to UX work.

63
00:02:31,04 --> 00:02:33,06
A discovery early on could change the direction

64
00:02:33,06 --> 00:02:35,09
of subsequent UX activities.

65
00:02:35,09 --> 00:02:38,00
So particularly if you present your contractors

66
00:02:38,00 --> 00:02:39,04
with hourly contracts,

67
00:02:39,04 --> 00:02:41,06
consider keeping the contract adaptable enough

68
00:02:41,06 --> 00:02:44,01
to give you flexibility later on in the process

69
00:02:44,01 --> 00:02:46,00
without needing to involve your contracts office

70
00:02:46,00 --> 00:02:48,03
or sending multiple change orders.

71
00:02:48,03 --> 00:02:51,05
Also, talk with your contractors as early on as possible

72
00:02:51,05 --> 00:02:54,02
about what equipment and software they already own

73
00:02:54,02 --> 00:02:56,03
and what they might need.

74
00:02:56,03 --> 00:02:58,08
Sure, you could be a stickler and require your contractors

75
00:02:58,08 --> 00:03:01,01
to have what you consider standard software.

76
00:03:01,01 --> 00:03:02,03
If they don't, however,

77
00:03:02,03 --> 00:03:04,08
see if you can build a license into your budget,

78
00:03:04,08 --> 00:03:07,01
or temporarily reallocate a license

79
00:03:07,01 --> 00:03:09,01
that your company may have.

80
00:03:09,01 --> 00:03:12,04
For the most part, contracting out work is negotiable.

81
00:03:12,04 --> 00:03:13,09
No matter the size of the business,

82
00:03:13,09 --> 00:03:17,00
whether a freelancer or a larger organization,

83
00:03:17,00 --> 00:03:19,03
they want your business.

84
00:03:19,03 --> 00:03:21,05
They're likely willing to talk through situations

85
00:03:21,05 --> 00:03:22,05
where their price offering

86
00:03:22,05 --> 00:03:24,08
is more than you can afford to pay.

87
00:03:24,08 --> 00:03:26,01
Or where their typical approach

88
00:03:26,01 --> 00:03:29,05
doesn't quite fit with what you are looking for.

89
00:03:29,05 --> 00:03:31,03
This is within reason, of course.

90
00:03:31,03 --> 00:03:32,09
For both an individual contractor

91
00:03:32,09 --> 00:03:34,08
and for a larger organization,

92
00:03:34,08 --> 00:03:37,06
it's a balance of availability and free time,

93
00:03:37,06 --> 00:03:40,00
and avoidance of effectively lost revenue

94
00:03:40,00 --> 00:03:42,03
if higher paid work comes through.

95
00:03:42,03 --> 00:03:44,06
In other words, as a contractor,

96
00:03:44,06 --> 00:03:46,05
I don't want to not work and would commit to

97
00:03:46,05 --> 00:03:48,08
a reasonably lower rate in the short term,

98
00:03:48,08 --> 00:03:52,04
knowing it won't displace other, more typically paid work.

99
00:03:52,04 --> 00:03:54,05
But should work at a more comfortable, hourly rate

100
00:03:54,05 --> 00:03:56,07
come through a month or more down the road,

101
00:03:56,07 --> 00:03:58,09
I don't want to be committed to something long term

102
00:03:58,09 --> 00:04:00,06
that is keeping me so busy

103
00:04:00,06 --> 00:04:03,07
I'm locked out of the preferred rate work.

104
00:04:03,07 --> 00:04:07,00
As a contractor, while I may be fine at a lower rate now,

105
00:04:07,00 --> 00:04:09,05
I'm also cautious about setting a future precedent

106
00:04:09,05 --> 00:04:11,07
for uncomfortably low paid work,

107
00:04:11,07 --> 00:04:14,00
when asked to help out in the future.
