00:00:01,00 --> 00:00:04,05
- We talked earlier about UX not being a single skill set

2
00:00:04,05 --> 00:00:07,07
or a career, but rather a whole collection of skills

3
00:00:07,07 --> 00:00:10,06
that form a variety of career pathways.

4
00:00:10,06 --> 00:00:13,08
Of course, in an ideal world with unlimited budget,

5
00:00:13,08 --> 00:00:14,08
you could bring in experts

6
00:00:14,08 --> 00:00:17,04
to cover each type of skill set that you need,

7
00:00:17,04 --> 00:00:21,04
but maybe you only have enough budget for a single hire,

8
00:00:21,04 --> 00:00:22,05
or you don't have enough work

9
00:00:22,05 --> 00:00:24,07
for a different unique UX skill set.

10
00:00:24,07 --> 00:00:29,00
So you may want to find everything you need in one person,

11
00:00:29,00 --> 00:00:31,02
the UX generalist.

12
00:00:31,02 --> 00:00:33,04
There's nothing wrong with wanting a UX generalist

13
00:00:33,04 --> 00:00:36,05
who can cover your business in multiple areas.

14
00:00:36,05 --> 00:00:38,05
If you're looking for a junior staffer,

15
00:00:38,05 --> 00:00:40,06
someone near the beginning of their career,

16
00:00:40,06 --> 00:00:42,07
you can find a generalist.

17
00:00:42,07 --> 00:00:44,08
There is no expectation of expertise,

18
00:00:44,08 --> 00:00:46,01
and within the framework

19
00:00:46,01 --> 00:00:47,09
of their interests and inclinations,

20
00:00:47,09 --> 00:00:50,06
you will have the opportunity to shape this person

21
00:00:50,06 --> 00:00:53,08
to exactly what your business needs.

22
00:00:53,08 --> 00:00:56,04
If you're looking for a UX expert however,

23
00:00:56,04 --> 00:00:57,09
someone who can lead the charge

24
00:00:57,09 --> 00:01:00,04
to get a particular aspect of your work done,

25
00:01:00,04 --> 00:01:03,02
be it design, research or strategy,

26
00:01:03,02 --> 00:01:05,02
that's when your desire for a generalist

27
00:01:05,02 --> 00:01:09,07
could be in conflict with the need for acquired expertise.

28
00:01:09,07 --> 00:01:12,05
It takes a few years to really become an expert

29
00:01:12,05 --> 00:01:14,06
in any given UX discipline,

30
00:01:14,06 --> 00:01:17,00
to experience the ins and outs of methods,

31
00:01:17,00 --> 00:01:18,08
software and approaches.

32
00:01:18,08 --> 00:01:21,03
The more UX skill sets you need to account for

33
00:01:21,03 --> 00:01:25,01
in a single person, the longer a period of time is needed

34
00:01:25,01 --> 00:01:27,02
to acquire that expertise.

35
00:01:27,02 --> 00:01:29,05
For example, someone who has been doing

36
00:01:29,05 --> 00:01:32,00
heavy interaction design work for five years,

37
00:01:32,00 --> 00:01:35,06
probably has a solid understanding of interaction design.

38
00:01:35,06 --> 00:01:38,03
If someone has been split evenly between interaction design

39
00:01:38,03 --> 00:01:40,06
and user research for the past five years,

40
00:01:40,06 --> 00:01:43,03
then while they likely have reasonable skills in both,

41
00:01:43,03 --> 00:01:46,03
they are not as experienced an interaction designer

42
00:01:46,03 --> 00:01:48,08
as the person doing this exclusively.

43
00:01:48,08 --> 00:01:51,08
Now mix in information architecture skills, visual design

44
00:01:51,08 --> 00:01:54,00
and imagine those are split evenly.

45
00:01:54,00 --> 00:01:56,02
How much expertise would you get?

46
00:01:56,02 --> 00:01:59,05
Oh, to make matters worse, let's imagine that you decide

47
00:01:59,05 --> 00:02:02,09
some front end coding experience is needed as well.

48
00:02:02,09 --> 00:02:05,04
No, front end coding really isn't UX,

49
00:02:05,04 --> 00:02:08,03
but it's often thrown in with UX job recs anyway.

50
00:02:08,03 --> 00:02:11,03
So now, you have a valid generalist, fine,

51
00:02:11,03 --> 00:02:14,02
but you don't have an expert in anything.

52
00:02:14,02 --> 00:02:16,09
If you didn't need the expertise then okay,

53
00:02:16,09 --> 00:02:19,07
but expertise counts for something.

54
00:02:19,07 --> 00:02:22,00
Speaking personally, while I'm happy to tell you

55
00:02:22,00 --> 00:02:24,00
that anyone can do user research,

56
00:02:24,00 --> 00:02:27,04
I make my living off user research expertise.

57
00:02:27,04 --> 00:02:29,00
Because I spent so many years

58
00:02:29,00 --> 00:02:31,04
almost exclusively as a user researcher,

59
00:02:31,04 --> 00:02:33,03
people hire me to propose exactly

60
00:02:33,03 --> 00:02:35,07
the right kind of research for their needs,

61
00:02:35,07 --> 00:02:38,00
to conduct that research in the right way,

62
00:02:38,00 --> 00:02:39,08
to appropriately gather information

63
00:02:39,08 --> 00:02:41,03
while dealing on the fly with varied

64
00:02:41,03 --> 00:02:43,06
and unanticipated situations,

65
00:02:43,06 --> 00:02:45,04
to record the critical data points

66
00:02:45,04 --> 00:02:47,04
that answer the research questions

67
00:02:47,04 --> 00:02:49,09
and to properly analyze that data.

68
00:02:49,09 --> 00:02:52,04
So yes, a generalist with some research

69
00:02:52,04 --> 00:02:54,08
among many other skill sets is a real thing,

70
00:02:54,08 --> 00:02:56,07
but this person is not going to be anywhere near

71
00:02:56,07 --> 00:02:59,08
the level of expertise of a research expert.

72
00:02:59,08 --> 00:03:01,06
No matter how much you want it all,

73
00:03:01,06 --> 00:03:05,00
just stay aware of what is realistic and what isn't.
