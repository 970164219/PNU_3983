1
00:00:01,00 --> 00:00:03,03
- You have UX work that needs to get done,

2
00:00:03,03 --> 00:00:05,02
and you need someone to do the work.

3
00:00:05,02 --> 00:00:06,00
Okay.

4
00:00:06,00 --> 00:00:07,02
So you just go out there.

5
00:00:07,02 --> 00:00:09,09
Let the world know you'll be needing a UX person real soon.

6
00:00:09,09 --> 00:00:11,07
Enough said, right?

7
00:00:11,07 --> 00:00:12,09
Good luck with that.

8
00:00:12,09 --> 00:00:16,00
You see, UX isn't a single career.

9
00:00:16,00 --> 00:00:17,09
UX is really an umbrella concept

10
00:00:17,09 --> 00:00:19,01
that includes a whole host

11
00:00:19,01 --> 00:00:22,07
of interesting and exciting job possibilities.

12
00:00:22,07 --> 00:00:25,06
This umbrella, this collection of careers,

13
00:00:25,06 --> 00:00:27,06
is focused largely on the point

14
00:00:27,06 --> 00:00:30,07
where people meet technology.

15
00:00:30,07 --> 00:00:34,00
UX jobs are largely focused on improving the experience

16
00:00:34,00 --> 00:00:38,00
of users' or customers' interaction with screens,

17
00:00:38,00 --> 00:00:40,01
such as a website on a computer,

18
00:00:40,01 --> 00:00:42,03
an app or website on a mobile device,

19
00:00:42,03 --> 00:00:44,03
or a use of wearables.

20
00:00:44,03 --> 00:00:47,08
And interactions with single use screens, like kiosks.

21
00:00:47,08 --> 00:00:49,09
But this is changing.

22
00:00:49,09 --> 00:00:51,09
UX principles are now starting to be applied

23
00:00:51,09 --> 00:00:54,01
to customer interactions with organizations

24
00:00:54,01 --> 00:00:56,07
in ways that go far beyond the screen,

25
00:00:56,07 --> 00:00:58,03
and beyond digital entirely,

26
00:00:58,03 --> 00:01:01,00
such as with live in person interactions.

27
00:01:01,00 --> 00:01:03,01
Regardless of technology or service,

28
00:01:03,01 --> 00:01:05,02
the UX professionals that you bring on

29
00:01:05,02 --> 00:01:07,03
are going to be focused on the people you serve

30
00:01:07,03 --> 00:01:10,00
and the products that you're creating for them.

31
00:01:10,00 --> 00:01:12,04
Your UX professionals will have responsibility

32
00:01:12,04 --> 00:01:14,04
for making sure that what you offer

33
00:01:14,04 --> 00:01:18,01
is wholly satisfying to these intended audiences.

34
00:01:18,01 --> 00:01:20,00
Bringing on a full-time permanent UXer,

35
00:01:20,00 --> 00:01:21,08
while perhaps most frequent type

36
00:01:21,08 --> 00:01:23,09
of employment relationship within UX,

37
00:01:23,09 --> 00:01:26,08
is by no means your only option.

38
00:01:26,08 --> 00:01:29,09
Rather, you may find that you have limited UX needs

39
00:01:29,09 --> 00:01:31,05
or you have UX overflow work

40
00:01:31,05 --> 00:01:33,08
that is only going to be temporary.

41
00:01:33,08 --> 00:01:35,08
So you've got plenty of options.

42
00:01:35,08 --> 00:01:37,09
Having spent a good chunk of my own career

43
00:01:37,09 --> 00:01:41,02
as a UX consultant, freelancer and micro business owner,

44
00:01:41,02 --> 00:01:43,03
I can tell you that UX employment models

45
00:01:43,03 --> 00:01:45,08
come in all shapes and sizes.

46
00:01:45,08 --> 00:01:48,04
Whether you need someone for a day, a week, a month,

47
00:01:48,04 --> 00:01:51,04
or a year, or as long as absolutely possible,

48
00:01:51,04 --> 00:01:54,03
there is someone who can help you.

49
00:01:54,03 --> 00:01:56,03
We'll talk about the types of business relationships

50
00:01:56,03 --> 00:01:58,08
you may have with your UX professional shortly,

51
00:01:58,08 --> 00:02:01,03
but the supply demand ratio means

52
00:02:01,03 --> 00:02:04,03
that they are a bit hard to locate sometimes.

53
00:02:04,03 --> 00:02:07,05
As we go, you'll learn how you can tap into that world

54
00:02:07,05 --> 00:02:09,08
to bring in the right people in the right way

55
00:02:09,08 --> 00:02:13,00
that fits your needs and your business.
