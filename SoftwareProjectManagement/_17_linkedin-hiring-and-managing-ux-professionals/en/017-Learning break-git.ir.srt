(uplifting music)

2
00:00:06,02 --> 00:00:08,03
- When I was young, when I was a teenager,

3
00:00:08,03 --> 00:00:10,02
I had this quote in my bedroom.

4
00:00:10,02 --> 00:00:12,00
Right across the door it said,

5
00:00:12,00 --> 00:00:15,05
"Some things must be believed to be seen."

6
00:00:15,05 --> 00:00:21,02
This quote, even as a teenager, it felt right to me.

7
00:00:21,02 --> 00:00:24,04
It felt like something meaningful

8
00:00:24,04 --> 00:00:28,00
that was driving my life even back then.

9
00:00:28,00 --> 00:00:32,04
But I didn't really understand how.

10
00:00:32,04 --> 00:00:38,02
It's all about saying that you can control luck.

11
00:00:38,02 --> 00:00:43,09
Everyone really has the power to improve the serendipity

12
00:00:43,09 --> 00:00:49,06
of their career, and it's really all about meeting people.

13
00:00:49,06 --> 00:00:51,03
It's interacting with people.

14
00:00:51,03 --> 00:00:56,08
This is the way that you can control your career

15
00:00:56,08 --> 00:00:59,07
by setting lots of things in motion.

16
00:00:59,07 --> 00:01:01,07
It doesn't matter whether you're a freelancer

17
00:01:01,07 --> 00:01:05,03
or whether you're a longtime employee,

18
00:01:05,03 --> 00:01:09,04
but at some point, there's going to be a new job.

19
00:01:09,04 --> 00:01:11,02
There's going to be new opportunities.

20
00:01:11,02 --> 00:01:12,05
There's going to be new adventures,

21
00:01:12,05 --> 00:01:15,06
however adventurous you want to get, related to your work.

22
00:01:15,06 --> 00:01:20,07
And it's all about setting everything in motion.

23
00:01:20,07 --> 00:01:23,02
It's about meeting people in different places.

24
00:01:23,02 --> 00:01:25,04
It's about meeting people at different times.

25
00:01:25,04 --> 00:01:29,01
It's about increased exposure to others.

26
00:01:29,01 --> 00:01:32,02
In my own career, I've found that all the work I've done,

27
00:01:32,02 --> 00:01:33,06
and all the projects that I've gotten,

28
00:01:33,06 --> 00:01:38,09
have been traceable to some meeting or some interaction,

29
00:01:38,09 --> 00:01:42,00
or some conversation, often in person,

30
00:01:42,00 --> 00:01:45,06
sometimes virtual too, as well, or through social media.

31
00:01:45,06 --> 00:01:48,00
But it's traceable.

32
00:01:48,00 --> 00:01:52,01
I don't respond to requests for proposals, or RFPs.

33
00:01:52,01 --> 00:01:58,01
I really just get work by meeting people, that's it.

34
00:01:58,01 --> 00:02:01,02
My business development time is meeting people.

35
00:02:01,02 --> 00:02:07,01
It's about caring about the other people too.

36
00:02:07,01 --> 00:02:09,09
It's not just about, "What can I get from you?"

37
00:02:09,09 --> 00:02:13,03
It's about, "I care about you as a person,"

38
00:02:13,03 --> 00:02:15,06
and I'm relationship building.

39
00:02:15,06 --> 00:02:19,09
I'm building this relationship with you and you and you,

40
00:02:19,09 --> 00:02:22,02
to the extent, and it's not about,

41
00:02:22,02 --> 00:02:23,08
"Oh, sorry, you can't do anything for me.

42
00:02:23,08 --> 00:02:25,09
"Bye, I'm off to the next person."

43
00:02:25,09 --> 00:02:30,06
Because, really, thinking practically, you never know.

44
00:02:30,06 --> 00:02:33,03
It's just getting to know people

45
00:02:33,03 --> 00:02:35,06
and building those relationships.

46
00:02:35,06 --> 00:02:37,00
