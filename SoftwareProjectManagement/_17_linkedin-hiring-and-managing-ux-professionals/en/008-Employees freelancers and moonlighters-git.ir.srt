1
00:00:01,00 --> 00:00:04,04
- There is UX work to do and someone has to do it.

2
00:00:04,04 --> 00:00:07,06
Maybe this is an employee or several employees.

3
00:00:07,06 --> 00:00:09,09
Maybe the work is done by a contractor,

4
00:00:09,09 --> 00:00:11,08
whether a freelancer or a moonlighter

5
00:00:11,08 --> 00:00:13,06
who has a regular day job.

6
00:00:13,06 --> 00:00:16,04
Or maybe you're using an agency or a larger company

7
00:00:16,04 --> 00:00:18,02
to contract out the work.

8
00:00:18,02 --> 00:00:21,06
There are certainly pros and cons to each option.

9
00:00:21,06 --> 00:00:24,02
In theory, in a world of agile development,

10
00:00:24,02 --> 00:00:27,04
UX should be as regular, iterative and ongoing

11
00:00:27,04 --> 00:00:29,00
as any other job.

12
00:00:29,00 --> 00:00:32,01
And maybe times that is true.

13
00:00:32,01 --> 00:00:34,06
If you have ongoing full-time UX work,

14
00:00:34,06 --> 00:00:36,07
the most economical way to get that work done

15
00:00:36,07 --> 00:00:39,02
is by bringing on a full-time hire.

16
00:00:39,02 --> 00:00:42,02
Hiring someone as a regular full-time employee

17
00:00:42,02 --> 00:00:44,04
of your company gives you the most control

18
00:00:44,04 --> 00:00:46,03
over their work and their time.

19
00:00:46,03 --> 00:00:49,04
In return for a level of loyalty and commitment,

20
00:00:49,04 --> 00:00:51,04
you as the employer should commit to invest

21
00:00:51,04 --> 00:00:55,08
in those employees, and help them to grow professionally.

22
00:00:55,08 --> 00:00:57,08
That said, there are a number of reasons

23
00:00:57,08 --> 00:01:00,08
that you might consider a contract position instead.

24
00:01:00,08 --> 00:01:04,04
UX is hot, and there may simply not be enough skilled talent

25
00:01:04,04 --> 00:01:07,05
to go around, making it hard to find employees.

26
00:01:07,05 --> 00:01:10,00
Or given these hot fields, you may find

27
00:01:10,00 --> 00:01:12,08
that limited available talent makes the hiring process

28
00:01:12,08 --> 00:01:14,08
take longer than you're anticipating.

29
00:01:14,08 --> 00:01:17,02
And you need someone to fill in the gaps

30
00:01:17,02 --> 00:01:19,07
as you continue your search.

31
00:01:19,07 --> 00:01:22,02
Or you may have irregular development cycles,

32
00:01:22,02 --> 00:01:25,01
so UX work, such as your user research,

33
00:01:25,01 --> 00:01:28,00
isn't always needed or budgeted.

34
00:01:28,00 --> 00:01:30,01
Or maybe there's already a UX team,

35
00:01:30,01 --> 00:01:31,08
but you have some overflow design work

36
00:01:31,08 --> 00:01:33,07
that needs doing urgently.

37
00:01:33,07 --> 00:01:34,09
In cases like these,

38
00:01:34,09 --> 00:01:38,01
a contractor can fill the gap with expertise.

39
00:01:38,01 --> 00:01:41,00
A freelancer is an individual contractor

40
00:01:41,00 --> 00:01:42,09
that represents their own business interest

41
00:01:42,09 --> 00:01:45,08
and functions as a limited contracting resource.

42
00:01:45,08 --> 00:01:48,05
I say limited contracting resource because their ability

43
00:01:48,05 --> 00:01:52,01
to help is defined by how much one person can do.

44
00:01:52,01 --> 00:01:54,09
As long as a designated freelancer is available,

45
00:01:54,09 --> 00:01:56,06
and as long as a business is willing to offer

46
00:01:56,06 --> 00:01:59,05
that person appropriate rate of pay, which may admittedly be

47
00:01:59,05 --> 00:02:02,04
higher for UX expertise than you might expect,

48
00:02:02,04 --> 00:02:06,00
it's possible to rapidly bring on a level of UX expertise

49
00:02:06,00 --> 00:02:08,07
without a need for long-term commitment.

50
00:02:08,07 --> 00:02:11,02
For example, I spent a decade as a freelancer

51
00:02:11,02 --> 00:02:14,01
focused largely in UX research and evaluation.

52
00:02:14,01 --> 00:02:17,01
While in my dream world research is done very regularly,

53
00:02:17,01 --> 00:02:19,04
this is not always the case.

54
00:02:19,04 --> 00:02:22,03
So in actuality, the user research that I do

55
00:02:22,03 --> 00:02:25,01
is well suited to freelancing.

56
00:02:25,01 --> 00:02:27,09
I often find that I'm called on to jump into a project,

57
00:02:27,09 --> 00:02:29,09
help assess some user needs,

58
00:02:29,09 --> 00:02:32,05
or perhaps how usable an existing product is,

59
00:02:32,05 --> 00:02:35,06
and then jump out after meeting the urgent needs.

60
00:02:35,06 --> 00:02:37,09
And then, I don't hear from the company again

61
00:02:37,09 --> 00:02:40,09
for a few weeks, or maybe a few months, until they,

62
00:02:40,09 --> 00:02:43,06
again, have an urgent need and no external experts.

63
00:02:43,06 --> 00:02:48,00
While I like the term freelancer, I'm also a micro-business.

64
00:02:48,00 --> 00:02:50,00
I'm not the only one who works directly

65
00:02:50,00 --> 00:02:51,04
for my company Lebsontech.

66
00:02:51,04 --> 00:02:53,02
And to deal with varying bandwidth needs,

67
00:02:53,02 --> 00:02:55,09
I've taken on subcontractors, others freelancers

68
00:02:55,09 --> 00:02:58,03
and small businesses, as I manage projects

69
00:02:58,03 --> 00:03:00,08
and typically take a lead role.

70
00:03:00,08 --> 00:03:04,01
A UX moonlighter is a special kind of freelancer

71
00:03:04,01 --> 00:03:06,08
who also has a day job, where they work full time.

72
00:03:06,08 --> 00:03:10,05
Moonlighters expand the options you have on who can help you

73
00:03:10,05 --> 00:03:13,03
with your UX work, and many have a good level

74
00:03:13,03 --> 00:03:15,08
of UX expertise as well.

75
00:03:15,08 --> 00:03:18,05
The downside is that since they have a full-time day job,

76
00:03:18,05 --> 00:03:20,03
which may not be so flexible,

77
00:03:20,03 --> 00:03:23,04
they may need to work exclusively off hours.

78
00:03:23,04 --> 00:03:24,09
And their first loyalty is going to be

79
00:03:24,09 --> 00:03:27,08
to their primary employer no matter how much you want it

80
00:03:27,08 --> 00:03:29,04
to be otherwise.

81
00:03:29,04 --> 00:03:31,01
But that said, you may find moonlighters

82
00:03:31,01 --> 00:03:32,01
are a little bit cheaper

83
00:03:32,01 --> 00:03:35,03
than their full-time, freelancing counterparts.

84
00:03:35,03 --> 00:03:37,07
All these options are focused at person level,

85
00:03:37,07 --> 00:03:40,03
but what if you have a project that you want to hand off

86
00:03:40,03 --> 00:03:43,00
to a team to get that project done?

87
00:03:43,00 --> 00:03:46,00
That's where a larger agency or consulting firm comes in.

88
00:03:46,00 --> 00:03:49,00
Let's now explore this a bit more.
