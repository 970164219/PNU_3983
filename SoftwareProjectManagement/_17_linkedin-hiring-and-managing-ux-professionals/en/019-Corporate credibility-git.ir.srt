00:00:00,08 --> 00:00:03,05
- How do you assess whether a business that you identify

2
00:00:03,05 --> 00:00:07,05
is actually an organization worth bringing on to help you?

3
00:00:07,05 --> 00:00:09,09
First off, look at what they tell you.

4
00:00:09,09 --> 00:00:12,02
If they write a proposal for the work,

5
00:00:12,02 --> 00:00:14,06
how do they prioritize UX?

6
00:00:14,06 --> 00:00:16,03
Look at the language they use.

7
00:00:16,03 --> 00:00:19,00
Do they talk about user experience throughout the process,

8
00:00:19,00 --> 00:00:21,01
and ideally in an iterative way?

9
00:00:21,01 --> 00:00:23,03
Or does it look like UX was thrown in haphazardly,

10
00:00:23,03 --> 00:00:25,07
just to win the bid?

11
00:00:25,07 --> 00:00:27,04
If they talk about past performance,

12
00:00:27,04 --> 00:00:31,00
is UX clearly integrated into those projects?

13
00:00:31,00 --> 00:00:32,00
Look at their website.

14
00:00:32,00 --> 00:00:34,03
Is UX prioritized there?

15
00:00:34,03 --> 00:00:36,08
If the business is large enough, look at job posts

16
00:00:36,08 --> 00:00:39,09
on their website, or do a quick search for job postings,

17
00:00:39,09 --> 00:00:43,06
and see if they hire for specific UX types of jobs.

18
00:00:43,06 --> 00:00:46,04
See if you can find UX people at that company on LinkedIn.

19
00:00:46,04 --> 00:00:49,00
And make sure that they too are properly branded

20
00:00:49,00 --> 00:00:52,00
as UX professionals, especially true if you know who

21
00:00:52,00 --> 00:00:54,00
is being proposed for your project.

22
00:00:54,00 --> 00:00:56,02
Even googling the company could get you some clues

23
00:00:56,02 --> 00:00:58,03
as to how established they are in the UX culture,

24
00:00:58,03 --> 00:01:01,07
and how employees may be involved beyond their regular work,

25
00:01:01,07 --> 00:01:04,06
for example, by speaking at conferences and events.

26
00:01:04,06 --> 00:01:07,05
Conversely, if you see that the company described themselves

27
00:01:07,05 --> 00:01:10,07
as doing UX, often with the slash-UI after it,

28
00:01:10,07 --> 00:01:12,08
and you notice that the core competencies

29
00:01:12,08 --> 00:01:15,01
look less like the kinds of UX we've talked about

30
00:01:15,01 --> 00:01:16,05
and more like something else,

31
00:01:16,05 --> 00:01:17,09
such as web or app development,

32
00:01:17,09 --> 00:01:20,08
be cautious of their UX expertise.

33
00:01:20,08 --> 00:01:24,01
They may have tacked on those letters, U and X,

34
00:01:24,01 --> 00:01:26,06
because they believe that they're doing UX work

35
00:01:26,06 --> 00:01:29,00
whenever they're creating a user interface.

36
00:01:29,00 --> 00:01:32,09
Or they may simply see UX inclusion as a useful SEO tool,

37
00:01:32,09 --> 00:01:35,06
without fully understanding what UX means.

38
00:01:35,06 --> 00:01:38,03
Either way, when UX comes without the users,

39
00:01:38,03 --> 00:01:41,02
represented by those core UX skills and services

40
00:01:41,02 --> 00:01:43,09
that we talked about, do not just go and accept

41
00:01:43,09 --> 00:01:46,05
their UX work at face value.

42
00:01:46,05 --> 00:01:48,09
If the business is a microbusiness, for example,

43
00:01:48,09 --> 00:01:51,04
a freelancer perhaps with one or two others,

44
00:01:51,04 --> 00:01:53,09
you can seek to establish credibility

45
00:01:53,09 --> 00:01:57,03
on the individual level as we discussed earlier.

46
00:01:57,03 --> 00:01:59,03
However, also make sure that the freelancer

47
00:01:59,03 --> 00:02:01,03
has an established business presence

48
00:02:01,03 --> 00:02:04,07
and clearly seeks out UX work as a business.

49
00:02:04,07 --> 00:02:06,09
Does a freelancer through a microbusiness

50
00:02:06,09 --> 00:02:09,03
clearly have business processes in place?

51
00:02:09,03 --> 00:02:11,03
For example, in the United States, do they know

52
00:02:11,03 --> 00:02:13,08
what you're talking about if you ask them for a W-9

53
00:02:13,08 --> 00:02:15,03
or a certificate of insurance?

54
00:02:15,03 --> 00:02:18,02
Or, alternatively, do your conversations with them make them

55
00:02:18,02 --> 00:02:20,01
sound like they are trying to just fill their time

56
00:02:20,01 --> 00:02:22,06
until they can get hired somewhere as an employee?

57
00:02:22,06 --> 00:02:25,02
It's not that you can't contract out to a freelancer

58
00:02:25,02 --> 00:02:27,01
as an individual, but in some ways,

59
00:02:27,01 --> 00:02:28,07
it gets a little trickier, both legally

60
00:02:28,07 --> 00:02:32,00
and in terms of how your relationship with them is framed.
