00:00:01,00 --> 00:00:03,05
- We've only lightly touched on these three buckets

2
00:00:03,05 --> 00:00:07,05
and associated jobs and skillsets at a very high level.

3
00:00:07,05 --> 00:00:09,04
And as you can start to see,

4
00:00:09,04 --> 00:00:13,00
sometimes there's a little overlap in those defined roles.

5
00:00:13,00 --> 00:00:14,05
If you're looking to hire someone,

6
00:00:14,05 --> 00:00:16,06
start by figuring out what you need,

7
00:00:16,06 --> 00:00:18,07
and do a little bit of research to confirm

8
00:00:18,07 --> 00:00:22,02
what kind of position will help you fit those needs.

9
00:00:22,02 --> 00:00:23,04
I had a client recently

10
00:00:23,04 --> 00:00:25,06
who developed a web based application

11
00:00:25,06 --> 00:00:28,08
that was a total failure among the intended users.

12
00:00:28,08 --> 00:00:31,03
They thought that by doing user acceptance testing,

13
00:00:31,03 --> 00:00:34,04
a typical development centric alignment activity,

14
00:00:34,04 --> 00:00:36,05
was user research.

15
00:00:36,05 --> 00:00:40,03
They didn't understand why this research wasn't working.

16
00:00:40,03 --> 00:00:42,05
What they needed was research with the people

17
00:00:42,05 --> 00:00:45,00
who actually use the product.

18
00:00:45,00 --> 00:00:46,04
They thought the developers

19
00:00:46,04 --> 00:00:50,01
hired to do a vague UX/UI development process

20
00:00:50,01 --> 00:00:52,03
would get them good user experience.

21
00:00:52,03 --> 00:00:55,02
But all stakeholders meant by UX/UI

22
00:00:55,02 --> 00:00:58,07
was an attractive user interface, not a usable one.

23
00:00:58,07 --> 00:01:00,05
They still have a lot ahead of them,

24
00:01:00,05 --> 00:01:03,03
but as their user researcher, I've gone to five cities

25
00:01:03,03 --> 00:01:06,02
and met with their actual users over nine days.

26
00:01:06,02 --> 00:01:08,00
I've documented what they need to do,

27
00:01:08,00 --> 00:01:10,00
and I'm now working with the UX design staff

28
00:01:10,00 --> 00:01:11,04
to create interactions

29
00:01:11,04 --> 00:01:14,00
that will actually work for these users.

30
00:01:14,00 --> 00:01:16,04
But this only came about because they realized

31
00:01:16,04 --> 00:01:19,02
that they really truly needed to understand

32
00:01:19,02 --> 00:01:21,03
the necessary UX skillsets

33
00:01:21,03 --> 00:01:23,07
and find those who have expertise in those skillsets

34
00:01:23,07 --> 00:01:25,02
to do the work.

35
00:01:25,02 --> 00:01:26,07
If you want to get one step deeper

36
00:01:26,07 --> 00:01:28,01
than what I've talked about here

37
00:01:28,01 --> 00:01:29,06
so that you too can better understand

38
00:01:29,06 --> 00:01:31,06
what you need for product success,

39
00:01:31,06 --> 00:01:34,04
check out my Planning a Career in User Experience course

40
00:01:34,04 --> 00:01:37,09
where we spend half the course expanding on these job types.

41
00:01:37,09 --> 00:01:40,03
Or look at my book, the UX Careers Handbook

42
00:01:40,03 --> 00:01:43,07
with about a quarter of the book, over 80 pages of detail,

43
00:01:43,07 --> 00:01:46,00
about these career types.

44
00:01:46,00 --> 00:01:48,00
Now that we've covered what UX is

45
00:01:48,00 --> 00:01:49,06
and the buckets of skillsets,

46
00:01:49,06 --> 00:01:51,06
let's turn our attention away

47
00:01:51,06 --> 00:01:53,04
from the details of the UX work

48
00:01:53,04 --> 00:01:57,00
and instead towards the people who are doing that work.
