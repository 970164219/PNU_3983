1
00:00:00,03 --> 00:00:05,01
(upbeat melody)

2
00:00:05,01 --> 00:00:06,07
- [Instructor] Here is my solution.

3
00:00:06,07 --> 00:00:07,08
We import logging

4
00:00:07,08 --> 00:00:10,04
and read the stderr from the sys module.

5
00:00:10,04 --> 00:00:12,05
We define the log_format in a separate line

6
00:00:12,05 --> 00:00:14,01
because it's long.

7
00:00:14,01 --> 00:00:15,08
You can read in the commentation,

8
00:00:15,08 --> 00:00:19,05
all the fields that are available inside the log record.

9
00:00:19,05 --> 00:00:22,05
In line nine, I'm using logging.basicConfig

10
00:00:22,05 --> 00:00:24,06
telling it that the stream is stderr,

11
00:00:24,06 --> 00:00:29,07
use our own format, and to use info-level logging.

12
00:00:29,07 --> 00:00:31,09
After that, we have the function hello

13
00:00:31,09 --> 00:00:34,00
and main that caused it.

14
00:00:34,00 --> 00:00:38,07
We can run the code, python app.py,

15
00:00:38,07 --> 00:00:41,00
and we see the desired output.
