00:00:00,06 --> 00:00:02,04
- There are many things that can go wrong

2
00:00:02,04 --> 00:00:03,08
while deploying your code.

3
00:00:03,08 --> 00:00:06,06
Let's go over some of the more common ones

4
00:00:06,06 --> 00:00:08,03
and how you can avoid them.

5
00:00:08,03 --> 00:00:09,07
You might use a new package

6
00:00:09,07 --> 00:00:12,04
and forget to add it to the requirements file.

7
00:00:12,04 --> 00:00:14,05
Or you might use a package in a version

8
00:00:14,05 --> 00:00:17,01
that differs from production environment.

9
00:00:17,01 --> 00:00:20,00
The solution is to have the CI system run tests

10
00:00:20,00 --> 00:00:23,01
in fresh environment every time.

11
00:00:23,01 --> 00:00:25,01
This will catch missing requirements.

12
00:00:25,01 --> 00:00:27,00
The second part of package mismatch

13
00:00:27,00 --> 00:00:29,05
is solved by creating a new virtual environment

14
00:00:29,05 --> 00:00:32,03
for every new deployment.

15
00:00:32,03 --> 00:00:34,08
Your deployment might have configuration issues.

16
00:00:34,08 --> 00:00:37,08
For example, broke name of the database server.

17
00:00:37,08 --> 00:00:40,05
The solution is to run a health check

18
00:00:40,05 --> 00:00:42,03
once the application starts

19
00:00:42,03 --> 00:00:45,02
and to add metrics to applications.

20
00:00:45,02 --> 00:00:46,09
This way, you will know quickly

21
00:00:46,09 --> 00:00:48,08
if something goes wrong.

22
00:00:48,08 --> 00:00:53,00
No matter have much tests, bugs will get into production.

23
00:00:53,00 --> 00:00:54,05
You should be able to detect bugs

24
00:00:54,05 --> 00:00:56,03
as soon as possible.

25
00:00:56,03 --> 00:00:58,07
The solution is to have metrics and alerts

26
00:00:58,07 --> 00:00:59,09
on your code.

27
00:00:59,09 --> 00:01:01,07
As a developer, you should incorporate

28
00:01:01,07 --> 00:01:04,00
metrics in your development process.

29
00:01:04,00 --> 00:01:07,03
Some people even run periodic health checks

30
00:01:07,03 --> 00:01:10,08
in production, to make sure everything is okay.

31
00:01:10,08 --> 00:01:12,03
The other thing you need to have

32
00:01:12,03 --> 00:01:15,03
is a way to quickly roll back a bad release.

33
00:01:15,03 --> 00:01:16,07
This is more in operation hands

34
00:01:16,07 --> 00:01:18,06
but you need to be involved.

35
00:01:18,06 --> 00:01:21,02
Writing deployable code will make you a good friend

36
00:01:21,02 --> 00:01:22,09
with the operation team

37
00:01:22,09 --> 00:01:25,08
and will let you sleep soundly at night.

38
00:01:25,08 --> 00:01:28,04
If you like to read a bit more, I highly recommend
