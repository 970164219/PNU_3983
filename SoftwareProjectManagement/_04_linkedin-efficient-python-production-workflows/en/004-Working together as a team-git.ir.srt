00:00:00,00 --> 00:00:02,00
- [Instructor] A good team is much more

2
00:00:02,00 --> 00:00:04,03
than just a bunch of people.

3
00:00:04,03 --> 00:00:06,02
But in order to work together,

4
00:00:06,02 --> 00:00:08,00
we need to have a process.

5
00:00:08,00 --> 00:00:10,06
This process will make the team more productive.

6
00:00:10,06 --> 00:00:13,01
Each member will need to help the process,

7
00:00:13,01 --> 00:00:17,03
Sometimes at the expense of their own productivity.

8
00:00:17,03 --> 00:00:20,01
A good process will also help us prevent errors,

9
00:00:20,01 --> 00:00:21,08
and when errors will happen,

10
00:00:21,08 --> 00:00:23,09
find and fix them quickly.

11
00:00:23,09 --> 00:00:25,07
There's nothing worse than a customer

12
00:00:25,07 --> 00:00:29,02
finding out there is a problem before you.

13
00:00:29,02 --> 00:00:31,01
Each company has its own process,

14
00:00:31,01 --> 00:00:33,09
and sometimes, teams inside the same company

15
00:00:33,09 --> 00:00:36,09
will have different process for working.

16
00:00:36,09 --> 00:00:39,03
What works for Google is probably an overkill

17
00:00:39,03 --> 00:00:41,00
for a small startup.

18
00:00:41,00 --> 00:00:43,04
What's a good process for the R&D team

19
00:00:43,04 --> 00:00:46,05
will be a bad match for the operations team.

20
00:00:46,05 --> 00:00:49,02
Remember that the process should serve you.

21
00:00:49,02 --> 00:00:52,04
If you find that the process is hurting your team back,

22
00:00:52,04 --> 00:00:53,06
change it.

23
00:00:53,06 --> 00:00:55,00
Nothing is set in stone.
