1
00:00:01,00 --> 00:00:05,06
(upbeat melody)

2
00:00:05,06 --> 00:00:07,00
- [Instructor] Here's the solution.

3
00:00:07,00 --> 00:00:12,03
In requirements.txt, we add gunicorn in version 19.9,

4
00:00:12,03 --> 00:00:15,05
which is the latest one during the time we're recording.

5
00:00:15,05 --> 00:00:18,06
Note that I've placed it between Flask and pytz

6
00:00:18,06 --> 00:00:20,03
to make sure that the dependencies

7
00:00:20,03 --> 00:00:22,04
are sorted alphabetically.

8
00:00:22,04 --> 00:00:24,03
And then in the Dockerfile,

9
00:00:24,03 --> 00:00:27,04
everything is the same except for the CMD line.

10
00:00:27,04 --> 00:00:29,08
We break the CMD line with backslashes,

11
00:00:29,08 --> 00:00:33,00
since it's very long, but the CMD is gunicorn,

12
00:00:33,00 --> 00:00:36,00
workers, bind, and then the application.

13
00:00:36,00 --> 00:00:38,04
Once you have that, you can build

14
00:00:38,04 --> 00:00:42,00
and run the docker as we showed before.
