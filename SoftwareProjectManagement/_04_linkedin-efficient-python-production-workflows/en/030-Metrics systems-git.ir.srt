00:00:00,05 --> 00:00:03,00
- [Instructor] There are many metric systems out there.

2
00:00:03,00 --> 00:00:04,04
There are self hosted ones,

3
00:00:04,04 --> 00:00:08,06
such as Prometheus, InfluxDB, the ELK Stack, and others.

4
00:00:08,06 --> 00:00:13,07
There are hosted solutions like Splunk, Datadog, and others.

5
00:00:13,07 --> 00:00:15,07
At one time I even used Google Analytics

6
00:00:15,07 --> 00:00:18,02
as my metric system.

7
00:00:18,02 --> 00:00:20,02
Some systems are push based,

8
00:00:20,02 --> 00:00:22,07
meaning your application will push metrics

9
00:00:22,07 --> 00:00:24,02
to the metric system.

10
00:00:24,02 --> 00:00:27,05
Others are pull based and will query your application

11
00:00:27,05 --> 00:00:29,05
for metrics periodically.

12
00:00:29,05 --> 00:00:31,05
No matter what system you use,

13
00:00:31,05 --> 00:00:34,09
learn its capabilities and how it can visualize your data

14
00:00:34,09 --> 00:00:36,07
to gain insights.

15
00:00:36,07 --> 00:00:40,00
Some systems have built in dashboard support

16
00:00:40,00 --> 00:00:43,03
and some require other system, such as Grafana,

17
00:00:43,03 --> 00:00:45,04
to visualize the data.

18
00:00:45,04 --> 00:00:46,08
Once you have your data flowing,

19
00:00:46,08 --> 00:00:49,06
think about what are the important metrics

20
00:00:49,06 --> 00:00:52,00
you'd like to show and where?

21
00:00:52,00 --> 00:00:55,00
Some teams place a big monitor with important metrics

22
00:00:55,00 --> 00:00:59,00
at central location, so everybody can view them.
