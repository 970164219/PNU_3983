00:00:00,05 --> 00:00:02,08
- [Instructor] In essence, metrics are measurements

2
00:00:02,08 --> 00:00:05,01
that tell us something about our system.

3
00:00:05,01 --> 00:00:08,02
For example, what's the current computer load?

4
00:00:08,02 --> 00:00:10,05
How much time did the query take?

5
00:00:10,05 --> 00:00:13,06
Metrics can be computed from our applications as well.

6
00:00:13,06 --> 00:00:16,00
How many visitors we had in the last hour?

7
00:00:16,00 --> 00:00:18,03
How much did we sell in the last day?

8
00:00:18,03 --> 00:00:20,06
Metrics are usually numerical

9
00:00:20,06 --> 00:00:23,03
and come with at least one extra piece of information,

10
00:00:23,03 --> 00:00:25,03
the time of the measurement.

11
00:00:25,03 --> 00:00:28,01
Metrics can contain more information apart from time,

12
00:00:28,01 --> 00:00:31,07
the server name, the application identifier and more.

13
00:00:31,07 --> 00:00:34,02
Since metrics are time serious,

14
00:00:34,02 --> 00:00:37,06
we can see trends, abnormal values called outliers,

15
00:00:37,06 --> 00:00:39,09
and other interesting insights from them.

16
00:00:39,09 --> 00:00:42,01
In my long career writing services,

17
00:00:42,01 --> 00:00:44,00
metrics has been super valuable.

18
00:00:44,00 --> 00:00:47,05
Today, I can't imagine writing a system without designing

19
00:00:47,05 --> 00:00:51,00
and implementing a metric system on top of it.
