00:00:00,05 --> 00:00:03,01
- [Instructor] A good process will help you avoid mistakes.

2
00:00:03,01 --> 00:00:04,01
By following a process,

3
00:00:04,01 --> 00:00:07,04
we take steps that are meant to prevent errors.

4
00:00:07,04 --> 00:00:09,09
Some of these steps are automation.

5
00:00:09,09 --> 00:00:13,04
Automating tasks is a great way to avoid mistakes.

6
00:00:13,04 --> 00:00:16,05
Machines are less prone to make errors than us humans.

7
00:00:16,05 --> 00:00:19,09
Checklists, checklists are great.

8
00:00:19,09 --> 00:00:21,08
Use them when you can't automate.

9
00:00:21,08 --> 00:00:25,03
Checklists embed best practices and eliminate errors

10
00:00:25,03 --> 00:00:27,03
that come from forgetting things.

11
00:00:27,03 --> 00:00:29,04
If you're skeptical about checklists,

12
00:00:29,04 --> 00:00:31,02
you can read The Checklist Manifesto

13
00:00:31,02 --> 00:00:33,09
or search for checklist in our offering

14
00:00:33,09 --> 00:00:36,04
and see how much it's mentioned.

15
00:00:36,04 --> 00:00:37,05
Knowledge transfer.

16
00:00:37,05 --> 00:00:41,02
A good process embeds knowledge acquired over time.

17
00:00:41,02 --> 00:00:43,06
For example, requiring a new test

18
00:00:43,06 --> 00:00:45,06
for every new piece of code.

19
00:00:45,06 --> 00:00:49,00
The cost of mistakes will heavily affect your process.

20
00:00:49,00 --> 00:00:50,08
If you're writing a small API server

21
00:00:50,08 --> 00:00:52,03
used internally by your team,

22
00:00:52,03 --> 00:00:55,01
the cost of error is not that big.

23
00:00:55,01 --> 00:00:58,01
However, if you're writing software for the Mars rover,

24
00:00:58,01 --> 00:01:02,00
any bug can mean billions of dollars going to waste.
