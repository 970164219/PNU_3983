00:00:00,03 --> 00:00:05,06
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:05,06 --> 00:00:07,01
- [Man] Here's my solution.

3
00:00:07,01 --> 00:00:09,01
In line eight, we write the decorator.

4
00:00:09,01 --> 00:00:12,08
In line nine, we add the attribute called num errors

5
00:00:12,08 --> 00:00:14,00
to the function object.

6
00:00:14,00 --> 00:00:16,01
And, initialize it to zero.

7
00:00:16,01 --> 00:00:18,04
In line 12, we write the wrapper function.

8
00:00:18,04 --> 00:00:20,04
It will try to run the function.

9
00:00:20,04 --> 00:00:24,01
And, in line 16 we check and if there was an exception.

10
00:00:24,01 --> 00:00:25,05
And, if there was an exception,

11
00:00:25,05 --> 00:00:28,06
in line 18 we incriminate the numbers of errors.

12
00:00:28,06 --> 00:00:32,01
In line 19 and 20, we log.

13
00:00:32,01 --> 00:00:36,04
And here is the uses example, we decorate the div function

14
00:00:36,04 --> 00:00:38,00
with our reports error.

15
00:00:38,00 --> 00:00:41,02
And in the main, we call it once, without an error.

16
00:00:41,02 --> 00:00:44,06
And, line 33 with an error.

17
00:00:44,06 --> 00:00:48,09
Python app.py, and we see that the div is called twice,

18
00:00:48,09 --> 00:00:52,00
but only on the second time, we get the error report.
