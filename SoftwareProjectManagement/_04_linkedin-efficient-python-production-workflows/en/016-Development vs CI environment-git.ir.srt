00:00:00,06 --> 00:00:01,05
- [Instructor] As your code grows,

2
00:00:01,05 --> 00:00:03,00
so does your test suite.

3
00:00:03,00 --> 00:00:05,03
At some point, developers won't be able to run

4
00:00:05,03 --> 00:00:07,07
all of the tests on their machine.

5
00:00:07,07 --> 00:00:10,08
This might be due to complex set up required,

6
00:00:10,08 --> 00:00:13,08
say a load balancer or a special hardware,

7
00:00:13,08 --> 00:00:17,03
or maybe just due to the time it takes to run the tests.

8
00:00:17,03 --> 00:00:18,07
Your rule of thumb should be the test

9
00:00:18,07 --> 00:00:21,01
the developer run on their machine

10
00:00:21,01 --> 00:00:23,00
should take less than a minute.

11
00:00:23,00 --> 00:00:25,09
In my experience, if a test suite takes longer

12
00:00:25,09 --> 00:00:27,00
than a minute to run

13
00:00:27,00 --> 00:00:30,02
developers won't run it as frequently.

14
00:00:30,02 --> 00:00:33,04
Pytest has a built in support for markers.

15
00:00:33,04 --> 00:00:36,03
You can mark tests, say with web mark,

16
00:00:36,03 --> 00:00:38,07
and then run only the web tests.

17
00:00:38,07 --> 00:00:41,05
See the documentation for more details.

18
00:00:41,05 --> 00:00:44,09
I recommend that at the beginning you will start simply.

19
00:00:44,09 --> 00:00:47,01
Split the tests to two groups,

20
00:00:47,01 --> 00:00:50,03
one the developers run and one that runs on CI,

21
00:00:50,03 --> 00:00:52,01
which includes the first group.

22
00:00:52,01 --> 00:00:53,03
Let's have a look.

23
00:00:53,03 --> 00:00:54,09
Here's a code example.

24
00:00:54,09 --> 00:00:58,02
I'm going to environment variable called CI

25
00:00:58,02 --> 00:01:01,01
to check if you are under the CI system or not.

26
00:01:01,01 --> 00:01:02,08
In line three, I'm importing environ,

27
00:01:02,08 --> 00:01:05,00
which is the environment variables

28
00:01:05,00 --> 00:01:07,06
and in line six, I'm setting is_ci,

29
00:01:07,06 --> 00:01:10,09
but true only if CI is inside the environment

30
00:01:10,09 --> 00:01:13,03
meaning we are running under the CI system.

31
00:01:13,03 --> 00:01:15,07
The test on line nine will run regardless,

32
00:01:15,07 --> 00:01:20,05
but the test on line 14 will run only if the CI

33
00:01:20,05 --> 00:01:23,00
environment variable is set.

34
00:01:23,00 --> 00:01:27,01
We're using pytest.mark.skipif for that.

35
00:01:27,01 --> 00:01:28,00
Let's have a look.

36
00:01:28,00 --> 00:01:33,03
In developer machines, so python -m pytest -v,

37
00:01:33,03 --> 00:01:34,07
and we see that we have two tests,

38
00:01:34,07 --> 00:01:36,08
but only the first one is running.

39
00:01:36,08 --> 00:01:38,01
The second one is skipped.

40
00:01:38,01 --> 00:01:40,07
Now we're going to set the environment variable for CI.

41
00:01:40,07 --> 00:01:45,03
So, CI equal yes and then the same line as before,

42
00:01:45,03 --> 00:01:48,08
python -m pytest -v

43
00:01:48,08 --> 00:01:50,06
and now we see that both tests are running.

44
00:01:50,06 --> 00:01:52,00
That's it.
