00:00:00,02 --> 00:00:06,00
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:06,00 --> 00:00:08,05
- [Instructor] Instead of running Flask Development Server,

3
00:00:08,05 --> 00:00:11,02
we'd like to run Gunicorn.

4
00:00:11,02 --> 00:00:14,06
And Gunicorn's latest version has a dependency

5
00:00:14,06 --> 00:00:16,03
in requirements.txt.

6
00:00:16,03 --> 00:00:19,01
Change the CMD directory into dockerfile

7
00:00:19,01 --> 00:00:20,06
to run gunicorn.

8
00:00:20,06 --> 00:00:22,07
Here's the command you need to run,

9
00:00:22,07 --> 00:00:26,00
gunicorn --workers 4,

10
00:00:26,00 --> 00:00:28,05
meaning running four workers,

11
00:00:28,05 --> 00:00:32,08
- -bind 000 $TIMEZ_PORT,

12
00:00:32,08 --> 00:00:34,01
bind to the port

13
00:00:34,01 --> 00:00:36,03
which is specified by the environment.

14
00:00:36,03 --> 00:00:41,02
And then, timez._main_:app.

15
00:00:41,02 --> 00:00:44,00
This the WSGI application it needs to run.
