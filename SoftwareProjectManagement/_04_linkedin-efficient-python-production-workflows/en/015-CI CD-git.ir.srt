00:00:00,05 --> 00:00:01,05
- [Instructor] We have a joke.

00:00:01,05 --> 00:00:03,05
I don't care if it works on your machine.

3
00:00:03,05 --> 00:00:06,06
You're not selling your machine to customers.

4
00:00:06,06 --> 00:00:09,00
CI stands for continuous integration.

5
00:00:09,00 --> 00:00:11,04
It's the practice of running the test suite

6
00:00:11,04 --> 00:00:15,00
on a remote machine every time we make a change to the code.

7
00:00:15,00 --> 00:00:17,02
CI helped detect a big class of errors,

8
00:00:17,02 --> 00:00:19,08
forgetting to add or delete a file,

9
00:00:19,08 --> 00:00:22,05
version mismatches, and more.

10
00:00:22,05 --> 00:00:25,01
CI also helps in integration problems.

11
00:00:25,01 --> 00:00:26,09
It can run tests that a developer

12
00:00:26,09 --> 00:00:29,09
can't run on their machine, due to time, resources,

13
00:00:29,09 --> 00:00:32,03
or other considerations.

14
00:00:32,03 --> 00:00:33,09
CI has become a standard practice,

15
00:00:33,09 --> 00:00:36,02
and there are many CI systems.

16
00:00:36,02 --> 00:00:39,09
Jenkins, Circle CI, Travis CI, and more.

17
00:00:39,09 --> 00:00:44,02
After CI, there's CD, which stands for Continuous Delivery.

18
00:00:44,02 --> 00:00:47,07
CD means that once the tests pass, they automatically deploy

19
00:00:47,07 --> 00:00:49,09
a new version to production.

20
00:00:49,09 --> 00:00:52,08
It's not easy getting to full CD, but there are companies

21
00:00:52,08 --> 00:00:54,09
who manage it and deploy hundreds of changes

22
00:00:54,09 --> 00:00:56,08
to production daily.

23
00:00:56,08 --> 00:00:58,04
I recommend you start with CI,

24
00:00:58,04 --> 00:01:00,05
and aim for CD only if you have the need

25
00:01:00,05 --> 00:01:03,00
and the resources available.
