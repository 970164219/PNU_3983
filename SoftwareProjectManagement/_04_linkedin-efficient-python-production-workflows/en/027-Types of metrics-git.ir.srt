00:00:00,06 --> 00:00:02,06
- [Instructor] There are several types of metrics.

2
00:00:02,06 --> 00:00:06,03
The names and definitions will vary from system to system,

3
00:00:06,03 --> 00:00:08,00
but the ideas are the same.

4
00:00:08,00 --> 00:00:09,04
I'm going to use the definitions

5
00:00:09,04 --> 00:00:11,07
from the popular Prometheus system.

6
00:00:11,07 --> 00:00:14,00
The most common type is a gauge.

7
00:00:14,00 --> 00:00:16,04
It's a value that can go up and down.

8
00:00:16,04 --> 00:00:19,02
For example, duration of a query.

9
00:00:19,02 --> 00:00:21,02
Another type is a counter.

10
00:00:21,02 --> 00:00:23,05
It's a value that goes only up.

11
00:00:23,05 --> 00:00:25,07
For example, the number of errors,

12
00:00:25,07 --> 00:00:28,05
which you can use for managing your error budget.

13
00:00:28,05 --> 00:00:32,01
Other common types are histograms or summary.

14
00:00:32,01 --> 00:00:35,01
They are an aggregation of values over time.

15
00:00:35,01 --> 00:00:39,00
For example, the number of website hits in the last second.

16
00:00:39,00 --> 00:00:41,06
Learn the metric types that are supported

17
00:00:41,06 --> 00:00:43,02
by the system you are using

18
00:00:43,02 --> 00:00:46,00
and use the right type for what you measure.
