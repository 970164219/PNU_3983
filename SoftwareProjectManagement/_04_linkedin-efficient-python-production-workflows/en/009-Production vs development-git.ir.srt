1
00:00:00,05 --> 00:00:02,00
- [Instructor] You might have dependencies

2
00:00:02,00 --> 00:00:04,02
that are used only in development.

3
00:00:04,02 --> 00:00:06,08
Test suites, linters, and others.

4
00:00:06,08 --> 00:00:08,05
The common practice is to have

5
00:00:08,05 --> 00:00:11,02
a separate requirements file for production

6
00:00:11,02 --> 00:00:14,00
and another one for development.

7
00:00:14,00 --> 00:00:17,00
Another issue is that depending on the operating system

8
00:00:17,00 --> 00:00:19,01
you might need different packages.

9
00:00:19,01 --> 00:00:20,03
The common practice here

10
00:00:20,03 --> 00:00:23,03
is to specify only the top-level dependencies

11
00:00:23,03 --> 00:00:26,03
and let pip decide what you need.

12
00:00:26,03 --> 00:00:28,09
For example, when we install pandas,

13
00:00:28,09 --> 00:00:31,08
pip will install panda's dependencies as well.

14
00:00:31,08 --> 00:00:34,01
Some people like to have these sub-dependencies

15
00:00:34,01 --> 00:00:36,03
in their requirements file as well.

16
00:00:36,03 --> 00:00:39,07
I prefer to have only the top-level ones.

17
00:00:39,07 --> 00:00:42,02
Here's our requirement file for production.

18
00:00:42,02 --> 00:00:44,09
We have pandas and we have requests

19
00:00:44,09 --> 00:00:46,04
and we have another file,

20
00:00:46,04 --> 00:00:48,07
which is the development requirements.

21
00:00:48,07 --> 00:00:51,01
And here it has the flake8 linter

22
00:00:51,01 --> 00:00:54,01
and pytest as a testing suite.

23
00:00:54,01 --> 00:00:57,04
You should automate the creation of the virtual environment.

24
00:00:57,04 --> 00:01:00,01
Here's an example using make.

25
00:01:00,01 --> 00:01:02,06
I have a rule to create the virtual environment

26
00:01:02,06 --> 00:01:04,01
and then in line five,

27
00:01:04,01 --> 00:01:07,04
I have a rule to create the development virtual environment,

28
00:01:07,04 --> 00:01:09,03
which is the virtual environment

29
00:01:09,03 --> 00:01:11,08
plus the development requirement.

30
00:01:11,08 --> 00:01:16,03
And now, I can do make dev-venv

31
00:01:16,03 --> 00:01:18,07
and makefile will run the commands required

32
00:01:18,07 --> 00:01:21,07
to create the development virtual environment

33
00:01:21,07 --> 00:01:26,00
and as you can see, in venv/bin/flake8,

34
00:01:26,00 --> 00:01:28,04
now we have the flake8 linter.

35
00:01:28,04 --> 00:01:30,07
Make sure your production installation process

36
00:01:30,07 --> 00:01:32,07
installs only the requirements

37
00:01:32,07 --> 00:01:35,00
needed to run the application.
