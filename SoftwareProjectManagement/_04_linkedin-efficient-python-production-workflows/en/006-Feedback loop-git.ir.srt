- [Instructor] As Heraclitus said,

2
00:00:02,01 --> 00:00:05,00
"change is the only constant in life."

3
00:00:05,00 --> 00:00:08,03
Over time, your production environment will change,

4
00:00:08,03 --> 00:00:11,00
your team will change, customers will change,

5
00:00:11,00 --> 00:00:13,03
as well as many other things.

6
00:00:13,03 --> 00:00:15,02
Your process should change as well,

7
00:00:15,02 --> 00:00:17,06
to accommodate for these changes.

8
00:00:17,06 --> 00:00:19,08
Your process should serve you.

9
00:00:19,08 --> 00:00:22,07
If you feel it doesn't, go and fix it.

10
00:00:22,07 --> 00:00:25,08
However, you shouldn't just blindly change things.

11
00:00:25,08 --> 00:00:29,04
You should make changes based on data.

12
00:00:29,04 --> 00:00:32,05
A nice model you can look into is the OODA,

13
00:00:32,05 --> 00:00:37,03
which stands for observe, orient, decide and act loop.

14
00:00:37,03 --> 00:00:40,07
Every time you make a change, you observe the affect it made

15
00:00:40,07 --> 00:00:43,00
and then make changes accordingly.

16
00:00:43,00 --> 00:00:44,08
Repeat forever.

17
00:00:44,08 --> 00:00:48,03
Our eyes into production and the way we can observe changes

18
00:00:48,03 --> 00:00:52,06
is monitoring, which we will discuss in other chapters.

19
00:00:52,06 --> 00:00:55,04
As DJ Patil, who was the Chief Data Scientist

20
00:00:55,04 --> 00:00:56,08
for the White House said,

21
00:00:56,08 --> 00:01:00,00
"if you can't measure it, you can't fix it."
