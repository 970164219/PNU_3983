00:00:00,05 --> 00:00:01,09
- [Instructor] Your services are running

2
00:00:01,09 --> 00:00:03,01
somewhere in the cloud.

3
00:00:03,01 --> 00:00:06,07
No screen is attached to the computer running your code.

4
00:00:06,07 --> 00:00:08,08
You need a way to know what's going on.

5
00:00:08,08 --> 00:00:11,00
I've consulted with a company that developed

6
00:00:11,00 --> 00:00:12,04
a cybersecurity suite.

7
00:00:12,04 --> 00:00:13,09
They had version one of the system

8
00:00:13,09 --> 00:00:16,04
and wanted to build version two.

9
00:00:16,04 --> 00:00:18,06
I asked them, "How is version one doing?"

10
00:00:18,06 --> 00:00:20,09
And they said, "It's doing great."

11
00:00:20,09 --> 00:00:23,00
Then I asked, "How do you know?"

12
00:00:23,00 --> 00:00:24,02
They really didn't

13
00:00:24,02 --> 00:00:26,00
and once we placed some logging

14
00:00:26,00 --> 00:00:28,08
we saw many many issues in the system.

15
00:00:28,08 --> 00:00:31,07
Logging is a way to write a piece of information somewhere

16
00:00:31,07 --> 00:00:34,08
and there are several decisions you need to make.

17
00:00:34,08 --> 00:00:36,02
What goes into logs?

18
00:00:36,02 --> 00:00:37,03
What format to use?

19
00:00:37,03 --> 00:00:38,07
How many logs do we store?

20
00:00:38,07 --> 00:00:40,07
Where do we store the logs?

21
00:00:40,07 --> 00:00:43,01
And several other questions.

22
00:00:43,01 --> 00:00:44,01
Before you start logging,

23
00:00:44,01 --> 00:00:46,07
think about these points and others.

24
00:00:46,07 --> 00:00:49,08
What do you want the logging system to provide?

25
00:00:49,08 --> 00:00:52,05
And then structure your logging accordingly.

26
00:00:52,05 --> 00:00:55,09
Another part of your ISO production is metrics.

27
00:00:55,09 --> 00:00:59,00
We'll talk about them in another episode.
