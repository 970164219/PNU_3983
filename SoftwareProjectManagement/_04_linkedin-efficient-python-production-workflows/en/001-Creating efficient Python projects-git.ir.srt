00:00:00,05 --> 00:00:01,05
- [Instructor] The ultimate test

2
00:00:01,05 --> 00:00:04,08
to your code is how it works in production.

3
00:00:04,08 --> 00:00:06,08
It doesn't matter the tests are passing

4
00:00:06,08 --> 00:00:08,09
if your code fails in production.

00:00:08,09 --> 00:00:11,08
Hi, I'm Miki Tebeka and I've been shipping

6
00:00:11,08 --> 00:00:15,01
Python code to production for over 20 years.

7
00:00:15,01 --> 00:00:16,08
In this class, I'll teach you how

8
00:00:16,08 --> 00:00:19,02
to make your code production-ready.

9
00:00:19,02 --> 00:00:21,05
A production-ready code will let you sleep better

10
00:00:21,05 --> 00:00:22,09
at night and will make you

11
00:00:22,09 --> 00:00:25,06
a good friend of the operations team.

12
00:00:25,06 --> 00:00:28,05
We'll discuss many concepts, from testing

13
00:00:28,05 --> 00:00:31,03
to logging and development strategies.

14
00:00:31,03 --> 00:00:33,00
All of these are not strictly related

15
00:00:33,00 --> 00:00:34,08
to coding, but crucial

16
00:00:34,08 --> 00:00:37,00
for having your code making a difference.
