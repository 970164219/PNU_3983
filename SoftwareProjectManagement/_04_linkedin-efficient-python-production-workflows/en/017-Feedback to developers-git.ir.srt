1
00:00:00,06 --> 00:00:03,06
- The CI machine run somewhere in the cloud.

2
00:00:03,06 --> 00:00:06,01
It can be your in-house Jenkins system,

3
00:00:06,01 --> 00:00:08,04
or a service such as CircleCI.

4
00:00:08,04 --> 00:00:10,05
When a test fail, you need some way

5
00:00:10,05 --> 00:00:12,09
to get notified about this failure.

6
00:00:12,09 --> 00:00:13,07
There are many ways

7
00:00:13,07 --> 00:00:16,05
to notify developers about failing tests.

8
00:00:16,05 --> 00:00:18,05
The worst one is email.

9
00:00:18,05 --> 00:00:20,07
I say that no matter what the problem is,

10
00:00:20,07 --> 00:00:22,08
email is not the solution.

11
00:00:22,08 --> 00:00:24,08
Most teams have a central chat room,

12
00:00:24,08 --> 00:00:26,01
and they hook the CI system

13
00:00:26,01 --> 00:00:28,06
to send notifications to this room.

14
00:00:28,06 --> 00:00:31,04
Some teams have a dedicated screen on one of

15
00:00:31,04 --> 00:00:34,00
the walls next to where developers sit.

16
00:00:34,00 --> 00:00:36,02
And it shows the last failing test,

17
00:00:36,02 --> 00:00:37,04
and sometimes the picture of

18
00:00:37,04 --> 00:00:39,07
the developer who caused the failure.

19
00:00:39,07 --> 00:00:41,04
The main thing you should avoid

20
00:00:41,04 --> 00:00:44,01
is notifications getting spammy.

21
00:00:44,01 --> 00:00:47,01
Once you flood developers with messages about CI,

22
00:00:47,01 --> 00:00:48,09
they will ignore them.

23
00:00:48,09 --> 00:00:52,04
Digital practice is to notify only on failing tests

24
00:00:52,04 --> 00:00:55,06
and the first successful test after failing one.

25
00:00:55,06 --> 00:00:57,06
If you have a test that fails a lot,

26
00:00:57,06 --> 00:00:59,06
remove it until you fix it.

27
00:00:59,06 --> 00:01:01,08
It's not worth having developer ignoring all

28
00:01:01,08 --> 00:01:05,00
the tests just because of one flaky test.
