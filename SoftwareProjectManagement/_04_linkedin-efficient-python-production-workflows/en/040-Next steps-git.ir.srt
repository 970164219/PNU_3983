00:00:00,00 --> 00:00:02,00
- [Miki] I hope you found the information

2
00:00:02,00 --> 00:00:03,04
in this course valuable.

3
00:00:03,04 --> 00:00:06,01
It embeds more than 20 years of my experience.

4
00:00:06,01 --> 00:00:07,04
Now it's up to you.

5
00:00:07,04 --> 00:00:08,08
When going back to work,

6
00:00:08,08 --> 00:00:11,04
try to think how you can improve your team

7
00:00:11,04 --> 00:00:15,00
and how you can make your code production ready.

8
00:00:15,00 --> 00:00:16,00
Start little.

9
00:00:16,00 --> 00:00:18,07
Add some logging here, some metrics there.

10
00:00:18,07 --> 00:00:19,09
Start a code review,

11
00:00:19,09 --> 00:00:22,08
and step by step you'll have a more efficient team

12
00:00:22,08 --> 00:00:25,08
and new friends from the Operations team.

13
00:00:25,08 --> 00:00:27,06
If you like to learn more about Python,

14
00:00:27,06 --> 00:00:29,08
we have many courses at all level.

15
00:00:29,08 --> 00:00:32,06
I tried to be platform agnostic in this course,

16
00:00:32,06 --> 00:00:36,03
but you have a specific platform and tools you are using.

17
00:00:36,03 --> 00:00:38,01
Go on and get familiar with them.

18
00:00:38,01 --> 00:00:42,00
AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, Docker, ELK Stack,

19
00:00:42,00 --> 00:00:44,04
there's so much to learn in this area.

20
00:00:44,04 --> 00:00:46,02
And of course, we have many courses

21
00:00:46,02 --> 00:00:49,00
in these subjects as well.

22
00:00:49,00 --> 00:00:52,08
And always feel free to reach us out at 353solutions.
