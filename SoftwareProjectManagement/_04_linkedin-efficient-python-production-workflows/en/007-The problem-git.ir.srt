- [Instructor] One of Python's models is batteries included.

2
00:00:04,00 --> 00:00:06,00
When you install Python, you get the rich

3
00:00:06,00 --> 00:00:09,00
standard library with many packages.

4
00:00:09,00 --> 00:00:11,08
A lot of times the standard library will be enough.

5
00:00:11,08 --> 00:00:14,03
However sometimes, you'll need a package

6
00:00:14,03 --> 00:00:16,00
that's not in the standard library,

7
00:00:16,00 --> 00:00:17,07
a third-party package.

8
00:00:17,07 --> 00:00:19,08
The center location for third party packages

9
00:00:19,08 --> 00:00:22,08
for Python is PyPI.

10
00:00:22,08 --> 00:00:27,01
At the time of recording, it hosts about 200,000 packages.

11
00:00:27,01 --> 00:00:28,09
It's a lot to chose from.

12
00:00:28,09 --> 00:00:32,07
That's one of the problems of third party packages.

13
00:00:32,07 --> 00:00:34,08
At first glance it's super easy to use

14
00:00:34,08 --> 00:00:36,05
a third party package.

15
00:00:36,05 --> 00:00:40,01
You pip install the package and its ready for you to use.

16
00:00:40,01 --> 00:00:42,07
However, you need a good process that will

17
00:00:42,07 --> 00:00:44,09
ensure that the work done in development

18
00:00:44,09 --> 00:00:46,09
will also run in production.

19
00:00:46,09 --> 00:00:50,04
On top of that, it's possible that the same server will

20
00:00:50,04 --> 00:00:52,04
want two or more applications.

21
00:00:52,04 --> 00:00:55,08
Each of them uses a different versions of a dependency.

22
00:00:55,08 --> 00:00:58,07
And some other things can go wrong as well.

23
00:00:58,07 --> 00:01:01,02
A package you are using can be discontinued.

24
00:01:01,02 --> 00:01:04,02
A package you are using can be malicious.

25
00:01:04,02 --> 00:01:06,08
A package update can crash your code.

26
00:01:06,08 --> 00:01:08,09
And many more things can go wrong.

27
00:01:08,09 --> 00:01:10,01
I highly recommend reading

28
00:01:10,01 --> 00:01:13,07
Russ Cox, Our Software Dependency Problem

29
00:01:13,07 --> 00:01:14,06
that even though it's not

30
00:01:14,06 --> 00:01:18,00
about Python, summarizes the problem well.
