00:00:00,08 --> 00:00:02,01
- Testing is important.

2
00:00:02,01 --> 00:00:04,03
It validates your code, and guards against

3
00:00:04,03 --> 00:00:05,09
breaking one part of the code,

4
00:00:05,09 --> 00:00:07,04
when changing another.

5
00:00:07,04 --> 00:00:08,04
If we read about testing,

6
00:00:08,04 --> 00:00:11,07
you notice that there are a lot of test types.

7
00:00:11,07 --> 00:00:15,03
For example, at the site How SQLite is Tested,

8
00:00:15,03 --> 00:00:17,04
you can see the following test types,

9
00:00:17,04 --> 00:00:21,02
out of memory, crash, fuzz, regression,

10
00:00:21,02 --> 00:00:22,03
and much more.

11
00:00:22,03 --> 00:00:24,08
Since you don't have time to implement all the tests,

12
00:00:24,08 --> 00:00:26,06
what should you focus on?

13
00:00:26,06 --> 00:00:29,07
The answer is, of course, what brings the most value.

14
00:00:29,07 --> 00:00:31,08
In my experience, the following test types

15
00:00:31,08 --> 00:00:33,05
yield the best value;

16
00:00:33,05 --> 00:00:37,01
however, it might differ for your project.

17
00:00:37,01 --> 00:00:39,05
Deployment, check that your deployment scripts work.

18
00:00:39,05 --> 00:00:42,03
Integration, this test check the connection

19
00:00:42,03 --> 00:00:44,06
between sub-systems and connections

20
00:00:44,06 --> 00:00:46,03
with external systems.

21
00:00:46,03 --> 00:00:49,07
Regression, these tests check that running the code

22
00:00:49,07 --> 00:00:52,09
over known data, returns a known solution.

23
00:00:52,09 --> 00:00:56,00
Fuzzing, these tests generate random data

24
00:00:56,00 --> 00:00:57,05
and through it at your code.

25
00:00:57,05 --> 00:01:00,02
Linters, these are static checkers

26
00:01:00,02 --> 00:01:03,05
that find common issues without running your tests.

27
00:01:03,05 --> 00:01:07,00
Unit, check your code in isolation for valid outputs.

28
00:01:07,00 --> 00:01:09,04
You should keep track of all the bugs

29
00:01:09,04 --> 00:01:11,05
that every kind of test find,

30
00:01:11,05 --> 00:01:12,06
and when you get a bug report,

31
00:01:12,06 --> 00:01:15,05
think what kind of test could have caught it.

32
00:01:15,05 --> 00:01:18,03
After a while, you'll know which type of tests

33
00:01:18,03 --> 00:01:19,06
bring the most value,

34
00:01:19,06 --> 00:01:21,02
and you should focus your effort

35
00:01:21,02 --> 00:01:23,00
on these types of tests.
