1
00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.050
- Okay, so, Agile is working fine

2
00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:10.050
on small software projects.

3
00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.040
There's, we talked about SAFe, Scaled Agile Framework

4
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.090
where they're trying to make it into big things

5
00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:18.080
and release trains and all of those things.

6
00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.090
But, what do you the future--

7
00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:23.050
do you think it will die off again?

8
00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:25.090
It will just become one of many tools?

9
00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:27.050
Is it going to get bigger?

10
00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:29.030
Is it going in the wrong direction?

11
00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:32.020
Tell me about the future of Agile, (mumbles).

12
00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.090
- Well, I think that one of the challenges around Agile

13
00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:41.050
is that it's generally not done very well yet.

14
00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.080
There's a lot of Agile coaches out there

15
00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:49.000
and I worry that there's a lot of bad Agile out there.

16
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.030
People who do the mixed approach that we talked about.

17
00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.030
And so managers and executives think to themselves, okay.

18
00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.080
This is kind of a West Coast weird thing.

19
00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.070
There's a lot of stuff in Agile that is questionable.

20
00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.010
Like shared spaces and things like that.

21
00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:05.090
There was a big move toward shared workspace,

22
00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:08.040
everybody sitting at the same table together and working.

23
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.060
Turns out there started and a lot of people hate it.

24
00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.000
Which I understand, I would hate it.

25
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.060
- Is that mob programming?

26
00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:14.060
Mobbing, of is that something different?

27
00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:15.060
(laughter)

28
00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.070
- Well, it's--

29
00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.090
- Going one step even further, everybody works

30
00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.000
on the same thing as a group.

31
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.070
I can't imagine how that would work, but still.

32
00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:23.050
- Sounds horrible to me

33
00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.010
but I've seen shared workspace and so there's a lot

34
00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:28.030
of practices that get thrown into Agile.

35
00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.070
I'm worried that executives and managers

36
00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.080
are going to be like, well, this Agile was interesting

37
00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.090
for a couple of years but is not quite ready for primetime.

38
00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.090
I think some of the scaling frameworks

39
00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.070
will only exacerbate that problem.

40
00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:44.030
Instead, they'll just say,

41
00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.030
why am I adding all these processes

42
00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.030
when it's not really adding that much value?

43
00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.030
I don't think they have great metrics

44
00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.050
about whether or not it's that much better

45
00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.030
than just doing a traditional deterministic

46
00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.070
waterfall style approach.

47
00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:00.000
But I'm much more optimistic about using Agile

48
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.060
for more scientific products.

49
00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.040
I think that Agile in data discovery,

50
00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.020
Agile creating A.I. products,

51
00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.080
where you're really figuring things out as you're--

52
00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.010
- A.I. is Agile almost by definition, isn't it?

53
00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.030
The machine is doing some sort of Agile process,

54
00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.060
you don't even know what it's doing.

55
00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.060
- Well, no one knows what it's,

56
00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.080
but if you're doing machine learning, it's a black box.

57
00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.020
But Agile's a very good approach, this kind

58
00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.080
of empirical approach because some of this stuff

59
00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.000
is getting so complicated.

60
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.040
You could never say what I want to do,

61
00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.080
'cause if you knew what you want to get from your data,

62
00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.070
then you wouldn't be exploring.

63
00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:41.000
And so these exploratory products are, I think,

64
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.040
very well suited to Agile.

65
00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.030
- Brilliant.

66
00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.060
Well, thanks very much for your time.

67
00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.080
Thanks for coming all the way from America

68
00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.080
to be interviewed (mumbles). - I know, terrific!

69
00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.050
- It's been fascinating and I think I'm a lot clearer now

70
00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:55.080
on where the edges are, what's good and what isn't

71
00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.010
about Agile, so thanks very much.

72
00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:59.010
Doug Rose.

73
00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.000
- Chris.
