1
00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.010
- So I can see that you get the flexibility

2
00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:08.030
and you learn from the customer

3
00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:10.060
and you can have those increments.

4
00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:14.000
Do you pay a price in terms of the time it takes

5
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.060
and it cost it takes,

6
00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:18.010
because sticking with the house analogy,

7
00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:20.030
if the flooring guy comes and does the kitchen floor

8
00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:22.030
and then later on comes back and does the bathroom floor

9
00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:23.050
and then does another floor,

10
00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:25.040
rather than just doing the floor in one lot,

11
00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:28.080
which you would do if you had a project plan,

12
00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.080
does it mean that projects take longer to finish

13
00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:36.060
and probably cost more if you do them in an agile way?

14
00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:42.050
- Yeah, well typically agile teams don't deliver projects.

15
00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.010
They are building products,

16
00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:46.020
which is distinguishable

17
00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.040
because your agile team is not thinking about

18
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:54.090
all the things that make a project,

19
00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.000
it has to be novel but with the iron triangle

20
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.060
and things like that.

21
00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:02.030
So with an agile team that's working on a software product

22
00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:03.070
or some sort of product,

23
00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.020
they should expect a lot of rework.

24
00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.020
XP teams say that, extreme programming,

25
00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.060
this is one of the frameworks used in agile.

26
00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:12.090
They say that you shouldn't be afraid

27
00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.070
to throw away software, if it's suboptimal.

28
00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:16.070
- Yeah.

29
00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.040
- And they call it software refactoring.

30
00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.080
Where you're optimizing it all the time.

31
00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.000
But the idea behind it is that it's much easier

32
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.000
to create a product and throw away work that's suboptimal,

33
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.040
than it is to try and plan everything out in the beginning.

34
00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.030
So you take that time you would've spent planning

35
00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.080
and you get rid of it,

36
00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.080
and instead you use it on adapting.

37
00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.030
And sometimes when you're adapting

38
00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.020
and learning from your mistakes you have to throw out work.

39
00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.060
But in the end you still save time

40
00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.000
because you don't have that planning, that big chunk.

41
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.020
- Yeah, and I guess that depends how long

42
00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.060
it takes to plan things.

43
00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.040
Or even whether it's possible to plan.

44
00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:56.070
'Cause I've got of a confession,

45
00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.030
as somebody who has got some prejudice

46
00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.070
against agile before this conversation.

47
00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.090
I had an app made, my Jobs To Do app,

48
00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.090
free on the app store folks.

49
00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.050
I made a Jobs to Do app

50
00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.060
because none of the jobs to do apps did what I wanted.

51
00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.080
And when I say I made it,

52
00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.080
I paid a guy to make it,

53
00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.090
really clever app guy I've got.

54
00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.090
And I think it wasn't possible for me to plan it,

55
00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.070
to think of everything beforehand.

56
00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:25.060
So we made it agile style.

57
00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.080
And we didn't have scrums and sprints

58
00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.070
and all that sort of thing,

59
00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:30.090
but basically I explained to him roughly what I wanted

60
00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.070
and he more or less understood,

61
00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:34.070
so I knew probably 80% of what I wanted

62
00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.030
and by the time I'd explained to him

63
00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.040
he understood probably 60% of what was in my head.

64
00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.020
I wasn't very good at explaining it.

65
00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:45.010
So he then made that,

66
00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:46.040
and then when I got it I sort of said,

67
00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.070
"Well I like it but could it be a different color,

68
00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:50.090
"and could this be over here, and could this be bigger?"

69
00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.030
And then we had version two

70
00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:53.050
and then I used it for a bit

71
00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:55.020
and realized I need an extra screen

72
00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.040
and I wanted it to go from small to big

73
00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.000
rather than big to small.

74
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.020
And we did about probably four iterations,

75
00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:04.040
which took longer and cost more

76
00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.090
than if he had just nailed it first time.

77
00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:10.030
But it just wasn't possible for me to even know

78
00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:11.070
what the finished thing was going to be like.

79
00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:13.020
And because it was software,

80
00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:15.030
he could easily just go back in and tweak it

81
00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:18.030
for another hundred pounds, and another hundred.

82
00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.000
And so by the end I wasn't bitter

83
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.010
about the fact that it had cost a bit more than we thought,

84
00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.000
because it was me that kept messing him around.

85
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
So I was fine with that.

86
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.050
And I kind of knew at the beginning of the process

87
00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:31.090
that that was how it was going to have to go.

88
00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.070
So I can see with software that

89
00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:36.020
you can change things halfway through

90
00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:39.010
in a way that you can't change with a house.

91
00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.010
And I can also see that with software

92
00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.020
it's harder to imagine sometimes what it's going to be like,

93
00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:46.000
so you have to be pretty flexible.
