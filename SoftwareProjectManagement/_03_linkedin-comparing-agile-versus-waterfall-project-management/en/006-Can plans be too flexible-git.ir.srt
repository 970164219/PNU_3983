1
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.080
- Now, can I ask you about embracing of change?

2
00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.030
And before we started filming,

3
00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.050
you mentioned that actually you think

4
00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:13.020
that conventional project management

5
00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:15.010
might even be too flexible.

6
00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:17.020
Because one of the things that,

7
00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:19.090
kind of irritates me about Agile people is they say,

8
00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:22.070
"Ah, yes well Waterfall's too inflexible."

9
00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:23.060
And that really annoys me

10
00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:26.000
because I don't think Waterfall is inflexible.

11
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.040
It seems to me that, yes, you start with a plan

12
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.040
but if the customer wants

13
00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.020
to change the plan at any time, they are welcome.

14
00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.070
It'll probably cost a bit more.

15
00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.080
And it'll probably delay the project a bit more,

16
00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.010
but it's no problem to change the plan.

17
00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:42.020
It just means that if you change the plan,

18
00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:43.090
you know the effect of the change.

19
00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:45.080
So I can tell you, "If you want to add on

20
00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.050
"this extra bit to the project,

21
00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:48.080
"it's going to take another three weeks

22
00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.020
"and cost another 5,000 pounds or whatever."

23
00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.080
So, and I'm not sort of punishing you

24
00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.020
'cause I'm against change,

25
00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.070
I'm just saying that's what it would

26
00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.000
cost to make that change.

27
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.010
And I kind of feel that with Agile

28
00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:02.030
if the customer changes something

29
00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.060
no one really knows the effect of that change

30
00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:06.030
because there wasn't a plan in the first place.

31
00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.050
So, yeah, we can easily do the changes

32
00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:09.080
but we don't know how much extra--

33
00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.000
and therefore we can't make a sensible decision

34
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.010
about is it worth making the change.

35
00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.080
Because if I was the customer and I said,

36
00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.050
"Oh, can I change the design of my shower

37
00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:19.040
"in my bathroom?"

38
00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.030
And the guy said, "Well yeah,

39
00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:21.050
"you can do that but it's going to cost

40
00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:23.010
"another 20,000 pounds."

41
00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:25.000
I'd say, "Oh, well actually in that case,

42
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.030
"let's not do it."

43
00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:27.060
Where as with Agile they might go,

44
00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.080
"Yeah, we can do that."

45
00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.060
And you'd never kind of know the effect.

46
00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.030
So, tell me a bit about

47
00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:33.060
do you actually, do you,

48
00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.080
'cause you know about Waterfall and Agile,

49
00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:40.030
do you believe that Waterfall is inflexible?

50
00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.080
And why might you even think it's too flexible?

51
00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.080
Which is a very weird thing to have said.

52
00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.060
- Yeah, I know.

53
00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.040
It's, no I do.

54
00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:47.080
I don't think that it's inflexible,

55
00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.070
like I said I think it's too flexible

56
00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.090
because when you're working on a Waterfall project

57
00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.030
then you can, you know, you receive changes

58
00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:56.040
kind of as you receive them.

59
00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.040
You know, there's a lot of times there's a process.

60
00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.000
You know, maybe you'll have a changed management team

61
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.030
or something like that.

62
00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.070
But it's very difficult to keep track of these changes.

63
00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.060
And you know, you have the iron triangle,

64
00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.040
where you add a certain amount of changes and then--

65
00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:09.060
- Which is cost, quality, and time.

66
00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.060
- Cost, quality, yes, thank you.

67
00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.080
And then the time goes up and then

68
00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.010
of course the cost goes up once the time goes up.

69
00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.060
And so, that to me seems a little too wishy,

70
00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.020
you know, a little too flexible.

71
00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.050
And also, a lot of times, since you're working,

72
00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.040
when you're on a Waterfall project,

73
00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.050
a lot of times, it's really difficult

74
00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:28.060
to keep track of time.

75
00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.050
You know, people will sit in a meeting

76
00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:32.000
and it will be scheduled for an hour,

77
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.060
it'll turn into two hours and no one really knows

78
00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.090
how much extra that's costing the project.

79
00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.000
And so, what-- if you're working with a,

80
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.020
on an Agile team, then every metric is locked.

81
00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.030
It's called a Timebox in scrum.

82
00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.070
In that, you deliver what you promised

83
00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:54.080
every two weeks over time.

84
00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.000
And so, you always, your product, your customer

85
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
always has this sense of this kind of sustainable pace.

86
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
And they always have predictable delivery.

87
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.050
And so, it's not-- you know, if you

88
00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:09.000
are going to add something, it's very easy

89
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.080
to keep track of how much it'll cost.

90
00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.050
Because it'll knock some things off of the next sprint

91
00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:17.000
and then you'll have to put new things in.

92
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
And so you can keep track of, sort of

93
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.070
what you're adding by saying,

94
00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:23.020
"Okay, well, you added this and so

95
00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:25.030
"it's going to add three more sprints,

96
00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.020
"I know that I have five people on the team

97
00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:29.040
"and so it's going to cost me this much amount--

98
00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.020
"this amount to sort of add those extra sprints."

99
00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:34.090
And so it's much easier to keep track of that stuff.

100
00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:38.030
And so, I think with a deterministic plan,

101
00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:39.080
you know, Waterfall or something like that,

102
00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.030
we are trying to go months or even longer in advance

103
00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.040
that teams sort of get-- lose track of time.

104
00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.000
- I mean, you can go into more granularity

105
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.070
and you can say, "We'll divide it into small bits

106
00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:51.030
"and we'll measure the small bits."

107
00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:52.060
So there are ways.

108
00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.060
- Yeah, it's just, but it's at every two weeks.

109
00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.000
- But I can see that you can see the progress.

110
00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.060
Well, there has to be the kind of project

111
00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.000
where you can progress as you go along.

112
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.030
I mean, some things you might not see

113
00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:03.030
progress for a while, I guess, but

114
00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:04.070
if you've got a project where you can

115
00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:07.050
see it in small bits, then Agile would show that.

116
00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:08.090
- Yeah, and that's, and that's exactly right.

117
00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:10.090
'Cause each, every two weeks, you're showing

118
00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:12.070
your customer exactly what they have.

119
00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:15.000
- So this, this locked-- did you call it

120
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.020
a locked down box?

121
00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:17.010
- Timebox.

122
00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:17.090
- A Timebox.

123
00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:19.020
- Mm-hmm (affirmative)

124
00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:20.030
- (laughs) I had a conversation with a guy

125
00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:21.030
on a course once, and I think that

126
00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:23.040
there are a lot of misconceptions about Agile

127
00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:25.070
and people think they understand it and they don't.

128
00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:28.040
And I was talking to this Agile guy and he was saying,

129
00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:30.070
"When we start the project, we don't have a plan

130
00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:32.070
"for the whole thing, you know, we really don't.

131
00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:35.060
"And every week, we look at the backlog of tasks

132
00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:37.080
"and we choose what to do."

133
00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:40.070
And I said, "So you don't know how long

134
00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:42.040
"it's going to cost-- you don't know how long

135
00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:44.060
"it's going to take in total, do you?

136
00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:47.080
"And also, you don't know how much it's going to cost?"

137
00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:49.070
And he said, "Well, no," he said.

138
00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:51.070
"Chris, that's not really true," he said.

139
00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:56.000
"I can finish the project on any date you want,

140
00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.070
"I just can't tell you what I would've done by then."

141
00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:00.050
(laughs) And I'm just thinking, well,

142
00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:02.030
that's just stopping halfway through.

143
00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:04.030
You know, you can stop when you run out of time

144
00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:06.080
or you can stop when you run out of money,

145
00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:08.090
but that's not what project management--

146
00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:11.050
Project management is saying, "I will finish

147
00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:13.050
"on a particular date and I will have finished

148
00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:15.050
"the whole job by that date

149
00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:17.070
"and I will have done it within the budget."

150
00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:20.080
And I'm thinking, is there something in Agile about,

151
00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.070
you put the deliverables in priority,

152
00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:24.040
and then when you run out of money,

153
00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:25.070
you've done all the top ones and

154
00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:29.030
you've done most of the others, so that's the result.

155
00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:33.000
Or can you really tell me when you will finish

156
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.070
and what the whole project will cost?

157
00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:36.050
- And that-- excuse me,

158
00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:37.090
that's where things get freaky again.

159
00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:40.000
So this, this idea of incremental

160
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.070
and iterative product delivery.

161
00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:46.020
So, if we went back to our house, which we talked about.

162
00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:49.030
So, if you're building it out a room at a time,

163
00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:52.040
you know, you've got your kitchen, you've got your bathroom.

164
00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:55.070
If that was an Agile product, your customer

165
00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:58.090
might decide that they don't need an extra--

166
00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:00.080
you know they don't need a living room,

167
00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:01.060
or something like that.

168
00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:02.050
I mean, that would be unlikely

169
00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:03.030
but maybe they only need

170
00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:05.040
three bedrooms instead of four.

171
00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:08.000
And so, since you're building it up

172
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.010
a room at a time, feature complete

173
00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:13.030
with a roof and everything, then

174
00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:14.090
your customer could say, "You know what?

175
00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:16.030
I'm running out of money.

176
00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:19.060
I will take this house with two fewer bedrooms,

177
00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:21.080
because I need to live in something

178
00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:25.000
and this is the date, you know, so let's just stop working."

179
00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.090
- And that would be the best thing to miss out.

180
00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:28.030
If you, if you run out of money,

181
00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:29.020
and you got to miss something,

182
00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:31.070
you want to miss the least good bit.

183
00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:32.060
- The least valuable.

184
00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:33.080
- So I can see the point of doing that last,

185
00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:34.080
if it's the kind of project where

186
00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:36.030
you can do things in any order.

187
00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:37.020
- Yeah.

188
00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:38.070
- Then I can see why you would do that.

189
00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:40.000
- Yeah, and that's, it's-- so that's

190
00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.090
incremental and iterative delivery

191
00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:44.070
and you're just sort of building it up over time

192
00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:48.000
and then whatever's left should be the lowest value.
