00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:06.040
- A friend of mine does refurbishing of buildings

2
00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:08.030
and we were talking the other day

3
00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:11.020
and he was saying that he always has

4
00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:12.070
trouble with the electricians.

5
00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:14.010
So they always say,

6
00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:15.090
"Oh, yeah, we can do that in four weeks."

7
00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:18.030
And then when he comes back after the first week,

8
00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:20.070
they've done nothing 'cause they've got four weeks.

9
00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.010
And then after two weeks they've done a little bit

10
00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.060
and he goes, "Are you going to finish this?"

11
00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.050
And "Yeah, it's going to be fine,"

12
00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.020
it's all going to come together at the end they say.

13
00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:29.040
The classic Waterfall, as you can say,

14
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.040
and then when he comes back after four weeks

15
00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.080
they go, "Oh sorry, yeah, we had terrible trouble,

16
00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.050
"it's going to take six in total."

17
00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:37.050
And he said this happens every time.

18
00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.080
And I said to him that's just granularity

19
00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:44.000
because if you don't allow the electricians

20
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.020
to say it's a four week job,

21
00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.000
if you say I want to see one week,

22
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.040
if you like sprints, just divide those tasks

23
00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.040
down into one week tasks,

24
00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.000
then firstly they've got to show you a plan

25
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.000
that adds up to four weeks

26
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.010
and when they're making that plan

27
00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.030
they might go, "Actually we can't do it in four weeks,

28
00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:59.040
"I've now realized,"

29
00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.060
'cause they've had to really focus on the detail.

30
00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:05.010
And if it is doable, they can't just waste the first week

31
00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.030
'cause they got ages,

32
00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.060
'cause they've got a deliverable the end of that week,

33
00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.020
which is kind of what you were describing.

34
00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.090
So I'm thinking you can have tight control with Waterfall

35
00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.080
if you granulate it down to whatever size you choose,

36
00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.030
I mean you could even have every day,

37
00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.030
I'm going to come and see how much you've painted.

38
00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.000
You know, you could do that.

39
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.040
And so I think that's not exclusive to Agile.

40
00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.090
I think that idea of having tight control,

41
00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.090
you could have that just the same in Waterfall

42
00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:29.080
couldn't you?

43
00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.020
- Well, it's slightly different,

44
00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.080
because you're talking,

45
00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:33.080
project management deals with the,

46
00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.070
you know better than I do,

47
00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.010
but with milestones and things like that.

48
00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:40.070
But remember when you're delivering your electrician,

49
00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.010
they're essentially delivering in phases.

50
00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.090
- Yeah.

51
00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.040
- They're just like this is the first phase, second phase,

52
00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.070
third phase, fourth phase.

53
00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.020
And so in Agile, you don't deliver in phases,

54
00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.040
it's Scrum typically.

55
00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.020
You deliver iteratively and incrementally.

56
00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.070
And so if you were going to have your electrician work

57
00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:59.020
in sprints and true sprints,

58
00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:00.090
not just like phases called sprints,

59
00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.010
which is a very common thing that people do.

60
00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:06.000
Then the very first sprint,

61
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.060
they would have one room completely wired.

62
00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.050
Everything, and it would be the most valuable room,

63
00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.080
the kitchen or something like that.

64
00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.080
And then they could walk in

65
00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.080
and they say, "Okay."

66
00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.070
And that way if the electrician gets sick,

67
00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:23.000
goes to Madrid, whatever the last thing.

68
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000
- [Chris] You've your best room.

69
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.070
- You've got three of your four best rooms.

70
00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:26.080
- Yeah.

71
00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.020
So yeah, so that's fascinating and if it was,

72
00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.010
but again you'd be mad to actually use Agile

73
00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.040
if you are wiring up a building, because I mean,

74
00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.040
I know the electrician could get sick or whatever,

75
00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.050
but it would be a very inefficient way to do the job.

76
00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:41.040
- And a thing to keep in mind

77
00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.050
which is one of the big advantages of Scrum and Agile,

78
00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:48.010
is that if you used a traditional phased approach

79
00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.090
then you'd have no rooms with electricity,

80
00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.090
or you'd have like, it all comes together at the end.

81
00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.060
So you'd have like two weeks

82
00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.020
before you're supposed to move into your house,

83
00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:00.070
none of the electricity would work

84
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:01.070
and then they flip a switch

85
00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:03.060
and all the electricity works.

86
00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.020
But with Agile. you can actually move into your house

87
00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.070
after the first or second sprint

88
00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.020
provided that you're okay living in your kitchen.

89
00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:11.040
- Or you can be making money

90
00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.000
if it's something that you're making that you can sell.
