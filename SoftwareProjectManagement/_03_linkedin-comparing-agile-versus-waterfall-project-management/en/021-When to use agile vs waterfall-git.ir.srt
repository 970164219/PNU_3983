1
00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:09.060
which one to use then, I think there's no doubt

2
00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:12.050
that manufacturing and that sort of stuff

3
00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:14.070
has to be traditional project management,

4
00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.040
which you call deterministic, which I always

5
00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:19.080
feel is you're somehow insulting it subtly.

6
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.070
(both laugh)

7
00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.060
I don't know if it's judgment, or whatever

8
00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.020
you want to call it, yeah.

9
00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:25.030
Sort of like control freak method,

10
00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:26.050
which I'm happy with.

11
00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.050
- I mean in terms of you're trying to determine

12
00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.050
what you're going to deliver at the end.

13
00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:30.040
- Yeah.

14
00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.030
And then there's no doubt that for stuff

15
00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:33.090
where there's going to be big pivoting,

16
00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.060
and it's software, and you can do things

17
00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.040
in order of importance and value,

18
00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.020
that Agile's got it's place, no doubt about that.

19
00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.080
Do you think there are some things

20
00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.080
where you could use both, and where

21
00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.050
it's difficult to choose?

22
00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.070
How would you advise a person to choose,

23
00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.000
'cause you understand both, you're not a dyed in the wool

24
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.090
Agile all the time guy, are you?

25
00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:58.050
- No, if you have your requirements,

26
00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.000
there's no reason to do it.

27
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.040
And the requirements are going to stay the same.

28
00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.020
- So that for you, that's the big factor

29
00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.080
is how well nailed down are the requirements?

30
00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.000
- Or if the customer's just like,

31
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.010
"Here's what I want."

32
00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:12.000
If a customer hands me a design spec

33
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.010
for a shoe, and says, "Here's what I want in six months,"

34
00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:17.050
I'm not going to be like, well let me give you

35
00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:18.080
a flip flop in two months, and then I'll give you--

36
00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.040
- But what about a website, for example?

37
00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.010
'Cause one of my customers recently said

38
00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:28.020
that they were going to build about 30,000 pounds,

39
00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.070
I could translate that into dollars, but--

40
00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.080
- Well I have an idea.

41
00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:31.090
- It's one-to-one at the moment, isn't it?

42
00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:32.070
(both laugh)

43
00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.020
It's $30,000 as well, oh the pound,

44
00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:40.020
but anyway, so it was a reasonable sized website,

45
00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.000
I didn't spend that on mine, and she was saying

46
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.060
that she had three people quoting,

47
00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.090
and two of them were Agile, and they said,

48
00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.010
"We'll work closely with you,

49
00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:53.050
"we know certain things you definitely want,

50
00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.070
"there might be some other things.

51
00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.000
"We don't know how long it'll take really,

52
00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.080
"we don't know what it'll cost,

53
00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.060
"but we'll do something really good, and trust us."

54
00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.050
And the third person was a Waterfall person

55
00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:06.000
who turned up and said, "Here's my Gantt chart

56
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.040
"of what I will do for you, and you'll get

57
00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:10.040
"all the things you told me about by this date,

58
00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:11.080
"for this money.

59
00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.000
"And you can change it if you want,

60
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.060
"but if you change it, it's going to cost you more

61
00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.050
"and take longer."

62
00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.040
And she went for the Waterfall supplier

63
00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.020
because she felt safer, and because she didn't

64
00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.060
know the Agile, I think if she'd known the Agile people

65
00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:27.040
and trusted them.

66
00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.070
So I think you could say, for a website,

67
00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:35.060
where you more-or-less know what you want,

68
00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.090
that Waterfall is probably a better way,

69
00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.010
but I guess there comes a point where

70
00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:41.070
if you want something really exciting

71
00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.080
and different, then you'd want to go Agile

72
00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.030
because the team are probably going to have ideas

73
00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.000
as they're going along.

74
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.030
So do you think that's what the essence is,

75
00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:53.090
to try to work out how much change there might be,

76
00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.080
and that's how you would choose your method?

77
00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.070
- Maybe, with her I would've steered her

78
00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:02.080
towards Agile just because if she's a novice at it,

79
00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.020
then you're putting a great deal of trust

80
00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:06.070
into people that you don't know.

81
00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:09.000
- I think she wanted a website that was kind of a bit

82
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
like the last one, only nicer looking,

83
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.030
'cause she's pretty boring.

84
00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.030
- Which is fine, as long as she knows the developers.

85
00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.080
But you have to remember that in a Waterfall,

86
00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.060
deterministic approach, I mean that in the nicest

87
00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.040
possible way, the deterministic approach is that--

88
00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.080
- I don't even like the word Waterfall.

89
00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:24.070
(both laugh)

90
00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:25.060
I just think it's a Gantt chart,

91
00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:26.040
it's not a waterfall.

92
00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.020
I know it looks a bit like a waterfall,

93
00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:29.040
it's a Gantt chart.

94
00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.010
I wish they'd call Waterfall Gantt.

95
00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:32.010
- It would be nice.

96
00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:33.060
- But anyway, we'll go with Waterfall,

97
00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:34.080
'cause that's what people call it.

98
00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.030
- It's so pretty.

99
00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:41.010
But I would advise her to work with an Agile team

100
00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:42.010
on the product because--

101
00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:43.020
- I knew you'd say that.

102
00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:44.060
- Yeah, I know.

103
00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.080
Although there are times, but she's putting a lot

104
00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.060
of trust in these teams, and so because remember

105
00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.000
they're going to be working, she's going to be paying them,

106
00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
they're going to be working presumably for weeks

107
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.030
or months, and then at the very end,

108
00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.060
she's going to get her project.

109
00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:01.030
She's going to get what she paid for.

110
00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:03.060
But if you're working with an Agile team,

111
00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.060
then every two weeks, she'll see it,

112
00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.080
and she'll see where things are going.

113
00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.070
And so if I were going to work on something

114
00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:12.060
and I was a novice, I hadn't worked

115
00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:15.020
with a team before, then I would use an Agile approach

116
00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:17.050
just because I wouldn't want to necessarily

117
00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:19.030
want to give someone a bunch of money,

118
00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:21.070
and then hope for the best.

119
00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:24.030
- And you don't trust the colored-in Gantt chart

120
00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.020
to give you that same thing?

121
00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:27.070
Because the stages in the Gantt chart

122
00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:29.050
don't show a fully working room,

123
00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:32.040
they just show let's say, foundations,

124
00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.040
which you can't prove.

125
00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:34.020
Is that?

126
00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:35.050
- Yeah, Gantt charts are great,

127
00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:39.060
but for me, I would prefer working software.

128
00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.010
It might be different if I were building

129
00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:42.070
a house, I wouldn't use an Agile approach.

130
00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:44.040
- Because you can physically see what they've done,

131
00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.000
whereas software, who knows if somebody's tapping

132
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.020
away at the computer going, "I'm halfway through,"

133
00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:49.020
and you just don't know.

134
00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:50.090
- Yeah, but if you've ever seen a house being built,

135
00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:52.080
that's also very nerve-wracking.

136
00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.090
And so I worked with a school, they were building

137
00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:58.000
a new school in Detroit, and I went out

138
00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.060
a week before school was going to start

139
00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:01.040
to do some IT stuff for them,

140
00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.060
and I looked and I said, "There's no way

141
00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:05.020
"that there's going to be kids in this school

142
00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:06.010
"in a week."

143
00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:08.030
It was like no walls up, or anything like that,

144
00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:11.000
and then like 100 people came in,

145
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.020
and they finished it within a week.

146
00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:16.000
So that for me would be anxiety provoking.

147
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.070
So I wouldn't want to do that in software.

148
00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:19.000
- But your Gantt chart would tell you

149
00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.090
it was okay in the school example.

150
00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:25.090
So is there anything other than software

151
00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:27.000
that Agile can work for?

152
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.040
You mentioned big data sets.

153
00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:32.080
To me that's software.

154
00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:36.020
Do you think you'd use Agile for anything

155
00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:39.060
other than IT really?

156
00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:40.080
- I think you could use it for anything

157
00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:44.070
that's more scientific than manufacturing.

158
00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:46.030
- Okay, yeah, so research and development

159
00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:47.070
type stuff then?

160
00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:49.010
- Yeah, and so anything where you're going to get

161
00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:51.050
a lot of value from a more empirical approach.

162
00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:54.050
You know, turning the knobs and seeing what happens.

163
00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:58.040
But there's a lot of things that I wouldn't

164
00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.010
use an Agile approach with, like I said,

165
00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:02.000
houses, cars, boats.

166
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.030
- So my map analogy, exploring Africa,

167
00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:07.010
when those guys were doing it in the 1800s

168
00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:09.010
or whenever it was, that's Agile

169
00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:12.010
because there is no map, and you don't know.

170
00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:16.030
Whereas driving to London, there is a map

171
00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:18.050
and it wouldn't be so appropriate.

172
00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:22.000
So anything where you really are in the unknown.

173
00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.030
- Well, not necessarily in the unknown.

174
00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:26.040
There's always a little bit you won't know

175
00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:29.000
with either approach, but I would say

176
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.010
anything where you get a lot of value

177
00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:35.030
from running experiments, from getting feedback.

178
00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:39.010
If that's valuable to you, then I would go

179
00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:40.010
with an Agile approach.

180
00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:42.060
If you want to see a product at the end of every

181
00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:45.040
two weeks, like your friend, I would go with

182
00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:46.070
an Agile approach.

183
00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:48.060
If you want to just get a Gantt chart,

184
00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:49.060
which I completely understand,

185
00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:52.030
look at it, and say, "Okay, I'll see you in six months,

186
00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:54.010
"I've worked with you before, I trust you.

187
00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:56.080
"Here's the big cheque, I'll see ya in six months,"

188
00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:58.030
then that makes perfect sense.

189
00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:01.040
- And you can have meetings with a Gantt chart,

190
00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:03.040
we've done the first stage and here it is,

191
00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:04.030
you can see it.

192
00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:06.050
The foundations are in, you can see them.

193
00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:07.050
- Yeah, absolutely, but ideally you'd

194
00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:09.070
want to just hand it off to them and go to Miami.

195
00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:10.050
- [Chris] Yeah, if you trust them,

196
00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:11.040
you don't need to do it, Miami.

197
00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:12.020
- Yeah, exactly.

198
00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:13.070
- I've never been.

199
00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:15.000
(laughs) I need to go.
