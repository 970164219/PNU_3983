00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.020
- I'm sort of thinking, if I was a customer,

2
00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.040
would I like Scrum?

3
00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.020
And I'd like the flexibility to change my mind all the time,

4
00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:16.010
that would be great, but I wouldn't like

5
00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:19.040
this thing about not having the iron triangle.

6
00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:23.010
Because if I'm a customer, I want to to say to you,

7
00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.080
build me this job and guarantee I will get this

8
00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.090
on this date, back to the iron triangle you know.

9
00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.020
I will get this on this date for this money.

10
00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:31.070
And if you said to me, "Well you know,

11
00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.000
"we'll just go 'til we run out and you know,

12
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.080
"we'll do quite a lot, you might get seven things,

13
00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:37.080
"you might get nine things,

14
00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.090
"we don't really know, and it kind of depends on you Chris,

15
00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.030
"how much you change your mind."

16
00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.040
I'd be thinking, well all the risk is with me.

17
00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.090
Now, I've got customers who agonize

18
00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:54.080
between do we quote fixed price for consultancy jobs,

19
00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.090
or do we just charge by the day?

20
00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:59.040
Because clearly, if you charge by fixed price

21
00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.040
then it's much more scary because you might not deliver.

22
00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.020
And you sort of think, well surely a customer

23
00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:06.050
would always want a fixed price,

24
00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:08.050
but actually they don't always want a fixed price.

25
00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:12.050
Because if you force me to quote you a fixed price

26
00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:14.010
I'm going to put in a margin on top,

27
00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.000
because the risk is with me.

28
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.070
So, I guess if got an agile team who I can really trust,

29
00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.080
and who I'm sitting with, working with all the time,

30
00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.060
you know, maybe the risk isn't completely with me.

31
00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.020
But I still feel as a customer

32
00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.020
it's a little bit out of control, for me.

33
00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:34.060
- And you don't have to really trust them either.

34
00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.070
Because remember, they're delivering every two weeks,

35
00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.000
so you can see if they suck much more quickly.

36
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:39.080
- That's true.

37
00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.010
Yeah, you would know, I mean you would know

38
00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:42.010
with a gunshot straight away,

39
00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:43.020
because you know that they're keeping up

40
00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.030
with the coloring in.

41
00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:45.090
Are we keeping up with the line?

42
00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.030
So the first task of the gunshot,

43
00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.020
you'd be able to see have they done it.

44
00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.020
So I think you do have just as much visibility

45
00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:54.050
but I do take the point

46
00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:57.050
that it has to be a working item, doesn't it?

47
00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.050
After two weeks, so you can really, really check it

48
00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:00.030
with Scrum.

49
00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.080
- Like your friend with the electrician.

50
00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.040
I mean, they may have been a great electrician

51
00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.000
but they won't know until the fifth week.

52
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.010
- Nope, nope.

53
00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:09.010
And the whole gunshot plan could be a big con.

54
00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:10.070
And you wouldn't know until the end

55
00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:13.010
unless you knew a bit about it, which you might not.

56
00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.040
Yeah, so you would say then that the customer

57
00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.080
isn't taking more risk upon themselves

58
00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.010
by going agile then they are with a gunshot.

59
00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.090
- No I would say they're taking less

60
00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.030
because instead of getting commitments,

61
00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.010
they're getting software.

62
00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.070
And so, you know, that's what agile,

63
00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:34.050
one of the agile principles in the agile manifesto

64
00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:35.080
is that you know, working software.

65
00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.080
And so it's, and that's how teams communicate.

66
00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.040
They communicate from working software.

67
00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.040
So you got...

68
00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.070
- But you don't know when the whole things

69
00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:44.060
going to be ready.

70
00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.040
Or if you do set a date, you don't know

71
00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.010
what you're going to get by that date.

72
00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:49.000
- Right, it's up to the customer.

73
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.010
- Whereas, in theory, with waterfall

74
00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.000
and a gunshot, you do.

75
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.040
Although in practice you may not, of course,

76
00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.080
because things might go wrong.

77
00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.090
- Well it depends on the customer,

78
00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.020
I mean if you work on an agile team

79
00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:00.050
and a customer doesn't have a lot of changes

80
00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:02.000
and don't care about the feedback

81
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.040
then they'll get exactly what you decided in the beginning.

82
00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.070
But if the customer does then, you know,

83
00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.050
then you still deliver what they wanted

84
00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:13.000
it's just much different from that first discussion.
