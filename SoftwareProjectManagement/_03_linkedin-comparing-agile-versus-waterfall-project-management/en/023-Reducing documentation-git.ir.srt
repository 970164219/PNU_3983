00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.030
- One of the criticisms that Agile people use of Waterfall

2
00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:10.020
that I feel is deeply unfair and hurtful is

3
00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:13.030
that Waterfall has loads of documentation

4
00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:16.070
and Agile, you don't have to bother with documentation.

5
00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:18.090
I would say that I think Waterfall doesn't have

6
00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.090
to have much documentation at all.

7
00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:22.060
You probably do need to use post-it notes

8
00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.070
to work out the running order of your tasks

9
00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.040
and you do need to have a Gantt chart of course,

10
00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.040
but that can just be on Excel, quite simple, you know?

11
00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.000
You might have a high level Gantt chart

12
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.020
and perhaps some sub-Gantts for some of the bigger tasks

13
00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:36.090
a bit more detailed but it's not a lot

14
00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.040
and I think you can plan a project in an hour.

15
00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.040
It obviously depends on the size of the project,

16
00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.010
but I think you can plan something pretty decently large

17
00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:47.070
in maybe two or three hours maximum

18
00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.090
and that's time well spent.

19
00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.050
So, I don't think that Waterfall has excessive amounts

20
00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.050
of documentation it it's done properly.

21
00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:58.000
I have seen horrendous ones, but if it's done properly,

22
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.080
and I suspect that Agile must have some documentation.

23
00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.090
I know you've got your Kanban board and you've got

24
00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:12.070
a backlog which you groom, but so tell, just briefly,

25
00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:14.040
because I'm not excited about documentation

26
00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.030
I've got to admit, but does Agile have significantly

27
00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.040
less documentation do you think?

28
00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.080
- Well, I think that Agile and the Scrum calls it artefacts.

29
00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.060
So, that's the--

30
00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:24.040
(laughs) - I know!

31
00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:25.020
- I love the names!

32
00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.010
- You have to come up with a new pretty odd name.

33
00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:28.000
The thing that Agile does, most Agile teams,

34
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.020
Scrum teams in particular, is that they split

35
00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.010
that documentation up into high-value documentation

36
00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:39.010
and low-value documentation and so no product owner

37
00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:41.070
is going to want to have documentation delivered at the end

38
00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.000
of a two-week sprint.

39
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.070
Just like, oh we didn't really develop any software,

40
00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.090
but man here's a great report about what your software

41
00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.000
will do eventually-- - [Chris] Yeah, yeah!

42
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.010
when we make it. - [Chris] Absolutely!

43
00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:53.010
- Exactly, so that's kind of of a bad sprint review,

44
00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:55.040
but there's a high-value documentation

45
00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.010
where the documentation can actually be the product,

46
00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:01.040
where if you're developing software and you have like

47
00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.090
a manual or something like that,

48
00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.080
then that can be delivered.

49
00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.010
If you're talking about the documentation that you create

50
00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:10.080
for each other to work, then Scrum tries to keep the

51
00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.000
low-value documentation, the e-mail back and forth,

52
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
the meeting minutes, all that stuff, the memos,

53
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.080
it tries to keep that to the bare minimum

54
00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.010
because you've got to deliver something in two weeks.

55
00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:22.000
- [Chris] Yeah!

56
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.080
- So, you can't really sit around and write long memos

57
00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.060
about work you're going to do in the future and so

58
00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.060
there's not really, since you're working with these

59
00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.090
small little innovative, you know, incremental chunks,

60
00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.030
there's not really a need to create the documentation.

61
00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.070
- And there's nothing bigger written down

62
00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:40.080
because you really don't have that longer-term--

63
00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.090
Right! - plan.

64
00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.090
- And the documentation in a deterministic Waterfall

65
00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.080
style plan is designed to limit communication.

66
00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.060
You know, if you create the perfect requirements document,

67
00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.000
then no-one will come back to you and be like,

68
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.090
"Chris, what do you need?".

69
00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:54.070
- [Chris] You never have to have talk.

70
00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:55.050
Exactly! - [Chris] That's the drain!

71
00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.000
- It's in the document, but it's--

72
00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.090
[Chris] Yeah! - and an Agile team,

73
00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:01.080
it's in the Agile manifesto,

74
00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.010
focuses on communicating, getting people that you

75
00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.070
and I sitting in a room talking about the product,

76
00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:09.050
will always be more efficient than you creating

77
00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:11.050
a document on your own and then giving it to me.

78
00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:13.010
That's true! - [Doug] I think so.

79
00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.070
- So, when you're building your imaginary house,

80
00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:19.040
not that it would be a house if you're using Agile,

81
00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.060
you don't have even a list of all the rooms

82
00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:23.090
you're going to do at some point.

83
00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:24.080
You just think,

84
00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:27.060
"Right, dear Mr. Customer or Mrs. Customer,

85
00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.050
"what's the most important room for us to do next?",

86
00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:32.000
and you just have that conversation.

87
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.070
You don't even have a list of all the rooms

88
00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:35.060
you're going to build.

89
00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.080
You know, you don't even that documented.

90
00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.080
- Well, you might do something that sometimes

91
00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.090
Scrum teams will work with, epics or something like that,

92
00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:44.080
which will be large groups of user stories,

93
00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.030
which you'll try to sort of figure out at the beginning

94
00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:50.070
and then you break down as you get closer to the sprint.

95
00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:52.050
So, I might have a conversation with you that's, say,

96
00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:55.050
"Okay, how many rooms do you want in your whole house?",

97
00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:57.090
but we wouldn't get into conversations like, you know,

98
00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.090
"Well, what kind of flooring do you want

99
00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:01.090
"in the entire first floor?".

100
00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:02.070
- [Chris] Yeah.

101
00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:03.090
- "Or what kind of, you know, how do you want

102
00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.040
"your walls painted?",

103
00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.000
because you're going to have a fully functional room.

104
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.020
So, you can look at the floor,

105
00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:10.030
you can look at the walls,

106
00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:11.010
you can say,

107
00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:12.000
"I like this!

108
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.080
"Do more of this!".

109
00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:14.070
- But the epic is a description of the whole house

110
00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:18.040
and the user stories are each room, kind of,

111
00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.060
are they written down?

112
00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:23.000
Would an epic be written down or, just very briefly,

113
00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.000
would it just be bullet points?

114
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.080
- I think you'd be very unsatisfied with an epic.

115
00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:29.030
An epic is just a sort of a big kind of statement

116
00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:31.010
about something that will be broken down

117
00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:32.020
into stories later on.

118
00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.050
So, it's not like documentation the way you might think

119
00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:36.010
of it in project management.

120
00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:38.040
- It's going to be, you're going to drive through London easily

121
00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:39.050
on a great vehicle?

122
00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:40.040
- [Doug] Exactly!

123
00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:43.000
- That's sort of, it's almost like the objective,--

124
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:43.080
Yeah! [Chris] the mission?

125
00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.090
- Yeah, and you might break it down further into,

126
00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:48.020
you know, it should not take very much gas.

127
00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:49.000
Yeah! - It should be able

128
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:49.080
to weave through traffic--

129
00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:50.070
it's quite good! - I quite like that actually!

130
00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:51.090
I've got to admit, I quite like that.

131
00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:53.080
- Yeah, it's not bad.

132
00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.030
- I'm just still worried about you starting work

133
00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:58.060
on it when that's all you've got but, yeah!

134
00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:59.050
I can get it.

135
00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:01.020
If it's software I can see!

136
00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:02.000
- [Doug] Yeah!

137
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
- If it's software only, the fact that you can change,

138
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.030
you know, as you did with my app,

139
00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:08.020
you changed all sorts of things around significantly

140
00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:10.010
as you went along and that worked well.

141
00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:11.040
- Yeah, and you could even do it more efficiently.

142
00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:12.020
[Chris] Yeah! - Like I said,

143
00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:13.010
if you was living in your living-room!

144
00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:14.040
It might be tough to explain to your wife,

145
00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:15.020
but they'll be there!

146
00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:16.000
- (laughs) Yes, exactly!
