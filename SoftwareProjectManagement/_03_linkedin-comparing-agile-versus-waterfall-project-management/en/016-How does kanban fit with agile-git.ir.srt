1
00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:06.030
- I want to ask you about Kanban,

2
00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:08.030
or Kanban as some people would call it.

3
00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:11.030
I think I probably used the proper pronunciation.

4
00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:14.000
Because I've come from manufacturing

5
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.080
and we used Kanban there as a way

6
00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.020
to keep work in progress down.

7
00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.070
Because just for the viewers, 'cause you already know this,

8
00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:25.070
the idea is that if I'm doing a job

9
00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:30.010
and I'm passing it to you, if you're slower than me,

10
00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:32.000
or you're ill or something like that,

11
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.030
I can just make a great big pile in between the two of us.

12
00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.040
And then, that means that the whole lead time's much longer,

13
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.070
'cause everything that comes through the process has

14
00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:41.090
to wait for ages while it gets

15
00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:43.050
through the queue before it gets to you.

16
00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.080
So the idea is to limit the work in progress

17
00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:48.020
to only a certain number, so you might have room for only,

18
00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.070
like, say nine, little three by three box between us.

19
00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.040
And when that box is full, I have to stop,

20
00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:55.060
and I've got to come and help you.

21
00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:57.040
I've got to say, "Doug, clearly there's a problem,

22
00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.010
"because you haven't taken anything out

23
00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.000
"of my little box where I put stuff."

24
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.050
And sometimes, if we're geographically spread,

25
00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:07.050
you might be coming and taking them from my box.

26
00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:08.070
But if you don't come and take them,

27
00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.000
I know there's a problem at your end

28
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.060
'cause they're still in the, this is right, isn't it?

29
00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.030
- Yeah. - So that's all great,

30
00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.080
and I love that, and then, I suddenly discovered

31
00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.020
that the Agile people are using Kanban.

32
00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.080
And when I had a look at their Kanban system,

33
00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.080
I was bitterly disappointed, 'cause I just thought,

34
00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.040
that is so ridic-- - It's abomination.

35
00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.080
- Yes, sort of facile, 'cause all they've got,

36
00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.020
their boxes are jobs to do,

37
00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.070
jobs we're doing, and jobs we've done.

38
00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:37.030
And sometimes you might have design and test,

39
00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.080
or there might be a couple of stages that they go through.

40
00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.050
But mostly it's just jobs to do, jobs we're doing,

41
00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:46.010
jobs we've done, and the only reason you could possibly call

42
00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:48.090
that Kanban, I guess, is because there's a limited number,

43
00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.080
amount of space on the board for Post-its.

44
00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.040
So it does limit to, say, to nine Post-its,

45
00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:58.010
so you can't have more than nine things in the queue.

46
00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:01.050
So it's sort of, but it's not really Kanban, is it?

47
00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:02.070
Or have I missed the point, is there something

48
00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.020
really clever about Agile Kanban?

49
00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.060
- Well, I mean, Kanban is, it came a little bit

50
00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.080
after the Agile Manifesto, but it was about, basically,

51
00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.080
managing queue size, you know, it's from queue theory.

52
00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.050
Actually, I ran into queue theory on the way over.

53
00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.030
I mean, I took the tube over, which is nice.

54
00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.060
But they could clearly put more than a few stills,

55
00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.020
these little things that you go through to get into the--

56
00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.010
- Oh yeah, the ticket reader.

57
00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.030
- Yeah, the ticket reader things,

58
00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.040
you know, and they've got three or four.

59
00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.000
And so, that's a Kanban system.

60
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.020
And so, if they put six or seven, when it's rush hour,

61
00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:36.090
everybody would come through, and they would cram onto--

62
00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.050
- I know. - Yeah, and they would cram

63
00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:41.010
onto the escalator, and the system would shut down

64
00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.080
because it would be crammed.

65
00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.040
There wouldn't be sort of a smooth flow

66
00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.090
of work through the system.

67
00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.050
And so, in software, Kanban is a way

68
00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:53.080
to maintain a sustainable pace

69
00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.050
when you have work going through a system.

70
00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:59.040
So typically, it's kind of an Agile way of working

71
00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.020
if you have a team that has operational, repeatable work.

72
00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:05.090
Something like a help desk ticket system,

73
00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:09.020
where you have all these people who are working

74
00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:11.040
on help desk tickets, doing operational stuff,

75
00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.070
helping people check their email,

76
00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:14.050
helping people fix their computers.

77
00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:16.090
So you have a huge amount of work that comes

78
00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.030
into the system, but you always have to have a steady flow

79
00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.030
of work to come out, otherwise the team will get overloaded.

80
00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:27.060
And so, some teams use Kanban boards for the Scrum board,

81
00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.050
the task board is basically a Kanban board.

82
00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:30.030
- [Chris] Is it really just the chops

83
00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.000
to do this, then, really?

84
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.040
- It's not, it's a way to show whether

85
00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.040
or not the team is going to deliver at the end of the sprint.

86
00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.050
That's kind of what the purpose of the task board is in Scrum,

87
00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:48.000
is that if you see everything stuck in doing and not done,

88
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.070
and you're a day or two away from the sprint review,

89
00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:52.090
then you know you're going to be in trouble.

90
00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.040
And so, it's a way to look at the board and say, okay.

91
00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.070
And in Scrum, you have to work on the highest priority work

92
00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:01.030
on the task board, so that's the stuff on the top.

93
00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:03.060
- So those are the tasks within one sprint.

94
00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:04.080
- Right. - And all those tasks have got

95
00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.030
to be done by the end of the two weeks.

96
00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.080
- Right, and so they have to go from top to bottom.

97
00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:12.030
And so, the highest priority moves across the board.

98
00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.050
And so, you can see, as a product owner,

99
00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:16.080
usually, typically a product owner than a scrum master,

100
00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:18.000
will look at the board and they'll be like,

101
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.070
"Oh my gosh, all of these tasks aren't going to be done

102
00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:23.070
"in the next two days, I'm going to be standing up

103
00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:24.090
"in front of the customer talking about

104
00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.010
"how it's a funny story, we didn't finish."

105
00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:28.080
And so, that's the purpose, really,

106
00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.080
of the task board in Scrum is to help the team

107
00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.000
regulate the work to make sure they're working

108
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
on the highest priority stuff from top to bottom.

109
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.010
But you can also use a Kanban team, a Kanban board,

110
00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:41.050
for operational teams to work on help desk tickets

111
00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:44.070
or things that are predictable work, but could come in,

112
00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:46.060
you know, you have to have a predictable output,

113
00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:48.070
but you could have a variable input.

114
00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:51.020
So you could get like, the email server could go down

115
00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:53.060
and you'll get 50 tickets in one day.

116
00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:55.010
But you can't just stand there and be like,

117
00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:57.060
"I'm overloaded," you have to start somewhere.

118
00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:59.010
And so, you just prioritize the work

119
00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:01.010
and pull it across the board.

120
00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:03.070
- And is that the same as your backlog of tasks,

121
00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:06.070
or is that a, there's a backlog of sprints as well,

122
00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:08.020
so could you have a Kanban board

123
00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:10.020
for all of that as well, for the higher level?

124
00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:12.040
- I don't typically use a Kanban board,

125
00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:13.080
or the product backlog,

126
00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:15.050
because you don't get that much value from it,

127
00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:18.020
because you're not really managing the work coming out

128
00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:20.090
of the system like you are on the task board.

129
00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:22.080
But what the product backlog will do,

130
00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:25.090
it will show you the product owner's highest priorities.

131
00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:27.050
And so, the product owner should

132
00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:30.070
constantly be shifting the product backlog to make sure

133
00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:34.070
that the stuff at the top is the most valuable to them.

134
00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:36.080
And that's slightly different from the Kanban board,

135
00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:39.000
which is more about just making sure

136
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.090
that the work the team produces is being done

137
00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:44.000
at a sustainable pace.

138
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.020
And you'll see that in Scrum,

139
00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:47.010
where they say they divide the work up based

140
00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:50.090
on the how and the what, is the product owner will decide

141
00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:53.040
what gets delivered in a two-week sprint.

142
00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:56.000
But the development team will come up with the how.

143
00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.010
They'll say, "Okay, here's how we're going to deliver it."

144
00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:59.060
And so, they'll typically work off

145
00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:02.030
of the Kanban board, or the task board.

146
00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:03.030
So, does that make sense?

147
00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:06.050
- Yeah, it does, actually, yeah, yeah, yep.

148
00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:09.070
I can see the Kanban board isn't quite as bad as I thought,

149
00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:11.020
although still not proper Kanban.

150
00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:12.030
- Yeah, I mean, it's 'cause it comes out

151
00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:15.000
of manufacturing, so-- - Yeah, yeah absolutely.
