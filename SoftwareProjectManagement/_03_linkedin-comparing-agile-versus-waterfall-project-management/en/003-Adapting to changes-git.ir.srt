1
00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.000
- So this idea of adapting to change,

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:06.090
this is one of the ideas that really

3
00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:09.030
worries me about Agile.

4
00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:10.030
And I don't know whether you'd use Agile

5
00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:12.030
ever to build a house, I think you probably wouldn't,

6
00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.040
but tell me in a minute.

7
00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.010
But I've been thinking, if we use house building

8
00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:18.030
as sort of an analogy, if you were going to build

9
00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:21.060
a house using Agile, you'd have a list of everything

10
00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.010
that was going to go into the house at the start, I guess.

11
00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:27.080
And clearly you can't put the roof on before the walls,

12
00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.010
that's not going to be a problem.

13
00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.070
It's not like Agile people are going to do things

14
00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.000
in the wrong order, because you physically can't.

15
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.050
So providing you do everything in some order,

16
00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:38.030
you might think that that's going to be fine.

17
00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.020
Why do you need a plan?

18
00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.010
But I've been thinking about this,

19
00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.050
and I think there are two reasons why

20
00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.000
you do need a proper plan from the start,

21
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.090
certainly with a house.

22
00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.080
And the first one is that there will be a critical path,

23
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.080
there'll be a longest sequence of things

24
00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:53.090
to build your house.

25
00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.050
And therefore, you want to start on that straight away

26
00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:57.050
if you're going to get the house built

27
00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.040
as quickly as possible.

28
00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.090
So if you're Agile and you don't really have a plan,

29
00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:04.030
and you're just doing whatever you feel like each week,

30
00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.080
then there is a risk that the first week

31
00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.040
you'll think, let's do the fish pond.

32
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.010
And then the week after you'll think,

33
00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:12.060
oh maybe we should start on the walls,

34
00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.020
and later on you'll regret that.

35
00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:15.080
You'll think, oh we should've started on the walls

36
00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.080
straight away, 'cause they were the slowest thing.

37
00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.060
So I'm just thinking, critical paths seem

38
00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.000
like a good idea, and I want to find out

39
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.040
if they're in Agile.

40
00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.030
But the other thing I was thinking is that,

41
00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.020
if you don't have a plan for the whole house

42
00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.070
at the beginning, you'll do the foundations,

43
00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.030
'cause you have to do them first,

44
00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.010
and then later on when you think,

45
00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:34.070
actually let's put a third floor on our house,

46
00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.000
you'll be thinking, oh we should've done

47
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.020
the foundations deeper.

48
00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:39.090
And if we'd known at the beginning it was going to

49
00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.060
be a three story house, we'd have done deeper foundations.

50
00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.050
So it's a bit of a complicated question,

51
00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:49.010
but I just wanted to know about the critical path question,

52
00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:52.020
and also the regretting later problem.

53
00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:57.000
And how does Agile handle all of that when you do projects?

54
00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.020
- Now this is going to really freak you out,

55
00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.000
'cause you would never use Agile to build a house,

56
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.090
but if you did, because software and a lot of digital

57
00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.030
products are much different from building stuff

58
00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.020
with concrete, and things like that.

59
00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.050
But if you did use Agile to build a house,

60
00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.090
or specifically Scrum, then what you would do

61
00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.010
is you would get together with your customer,

62
00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.090
and you would decide which room in your house

63
00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.000
is the most valuable.

64
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.040
Now for a lot of people, it would be a bathroom.

65
00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.050
So that's the room that you need the most

66
00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:31.030
in your house.

67
00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:32.060
Other people would be a kitchen.

68
00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.050
- I was going to say it's a little bit weird--

69
00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:34.080
- They'd just go outside.

70
00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.090
Yeah, so just a kitchen and then just a bucket outside.

71
00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.020
But whatever it is, you would work with your customer

72
00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:43.070
to figure out what the highest value part

73
00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:46.010
of your house is, the room, and then you would

74
00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.060
build out this bathroom completely.

75
00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.080
It would be suspended on the third floor,

76
00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.020
completely built out, the faucets would work,

77
00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:58.050
the sink would work, everything,

78
00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.070
the toilet would work, the shower would work,

79
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:01.070
all the finishing would be in there.

80
00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:03.040
- So for house building, this is completely mad,

81
00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.050
but for software, I can see how that would work.

82
00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:10.040
'Cause you do the most important feature first, and then?

83
00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.090
- And then it's complete.

84
00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.080
And so your customer could essentially live

85
00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:18.020
in their house, just in their bathroom.

86
00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:20.070
And so they would have just a one bathroom,

87
00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:22.000
but it would completely work.

88
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.080
And so that's a really tricky thing for a lot of people

89
00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.060
when they're coming away from Waterfall

90
00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.010
is this idea of what's called incremental

91
00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:30.020
and iterative delivery.

92
00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:31.080
- Yeah, you're messing with my head already.

93
00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:32.070
- I know.

94
00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:33.050
- You've only just started.

95
00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:34.090
- I know, it's crazy.

96
00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.090
But if you're coming from a Waterfall background,

97
00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.080
or from any kind of deterministic planning background,

98
00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.020
then this idea of incremental and iterative

99
00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:44.090
delivery is freaky.

100
00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:47.070
- So you do the one most important thing first,

101
00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:50.080
and then you can build on that from then on.

102
00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:53.000
So you couldn't use it for something like a house,

103
00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.060
or anything where you can't do the most

104
00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.070
important thing first.

105
00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:59.030
- Well you don't want to use it for anything

106
00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:01.050
that's like manufacturing.

107
00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:03.090
Because classic Waterfall, deterministic planning

108
00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.060
comes out of manufacturing.

109
00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:08.050
And so anything that's steel and concrete

110
00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:11.050
that can't easily be built on, reassembled,

111
00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:13.090
that type of thing, is going to be difficult

112
00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:18.020
to have an a team with an Agile mindset work on it.

113
00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:21.070
But once you have your bathroom completely built,

114
00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:24.000
then your team would move onto the kitchen

115
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.060
if that was the second highest value item,

116
00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:30.000
and then make the kitchen complete, everything.

117
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.070
The Viking appliances, the floor, everything

118
00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:34.010
like that's complete.

119
00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:35.090
Now of course you'd never do that with a house

120
00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:38.000
because you would never want to make a wood floor

121
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.090
complete in one room, and then leave the rest

122
00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:44.010
of the house just on stilts.

123
00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:45.060
- 'Cause you might need to put wires through

124
00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:47.040
to get to the sitting room later,

125
00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.030
and you'd have to take the floor back up, or whatever.

126
00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:51.020
- And people don't work that way when they're

127
00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:52.000
building a house.

128
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.040
You don't bring in the flooring person in for one week,

129
00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:56.090
and then you send them off.

130
00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:00.000
But for software development, it gives you a lot

131
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.070
of valuable insight into how the rest

132
00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:04.060
of your product will look.

133
00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:06.060
And so when you have a part of your product

134
00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:08.090
that's feature complete, typically only

135
00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:13.030
after a sprint or two, then you get a lot of insights

136
00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:15.080
into what your customer's priorities are.

137
00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:19.010
And so you can build off of that iteratively

138
00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:23.020
and incrementally, until you build out a product that way,

139
00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:25.060
giving your customer a chance to give you feedback,

140
00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:28.040
which is a key part of Scrum and Agile mindset,

141
00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:32.060
and then build off, and not only get feedback,

142
00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:35.000
but learn lessons as you're building.
