00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:07.080
- So, if you were doing something bigger like, say a website

2
00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.000
and something where you could

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.090
actually visualize the finished product,

4
00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:13.000
then it seems to me that

5
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.030
it would still be worth having a plan

6
00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.050
rather than doing it in some sort of suboptimal order.

7
00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.020
So I'm thinking that even with some software

8
00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:23.040
if it's possible to plan it,

9
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.050
maybe it would be a benefit to plan it

10
00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.010
rather than do it, doing it agile style.

11
00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:32.000
- Yeah, I mean, I would with your app, it was agile-ish.

12
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.060
I wouldn't say it was full agile.

13
00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:35.070
If you were actually developing an app,

14
00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.040
which a lot of people do when they're developing,

15
00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.030
you know, these apps in the app store,

16
00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.000
I mean, it seems like there's software everywhere,

17
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.090
you would be sitting right next to your developer,

18
00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.080
and they would work right next to you all the time.

19
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.030
And so the commitment, when you're the customer

20
00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.080
and you're trying to sort of have a product delivered

21
00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.090
using the more agile mindset is

22
00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.010
you have to have the customer really sit

23
00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.070
with the development team and be part of the team.

24
00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.020
And so imagine if your developer that you hired to do this

25
00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.090
was like sitting in your living room

26
00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.030
developing it all day while you were eating cereal,

27
00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.060
watching Netflix, whatever,

28
00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.000
and they could just turn around and ask you a question

29
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.020
and you could turn back,

30
00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:19.080
and they would just be able to work

31
00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.070
sort of at a nice sustainable pace that way.

32
00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:22.050
- That would be great.

33
00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:23.040
- Yeah

34
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.020
That would be a real luxury if you could do it.

35
00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.010
- And then they would finish it really quickly

36
00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:28.050
and it would be exactly what you want,

37
00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:31.020
because you're always getting that realtime feedback.

38
00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.030
But, if you work an agile team, they don't really see it

39
00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.050
as a luxury as much as a necessity,

40
00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:39.080
because even though it would be awkward

41
00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.070
to have a software developer sitting in your living room,

42
00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:47.040
that the productivity gains you get from it are enormous.

43
00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.030
And so, and I work in a lot of organizations

44
00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.030
where they have difficulty with this concept

45
00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.070
because they're used to business analysts

46
00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.050
and things like that, who just come up with requirements,

47
00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.000
kind of throw them over the wall,

48
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.090
and then say, "Okay, that's your responsibility."

49
00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.040
- That's what I did with my app.

50
00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.090
I just said, "Make me this."

51
00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.070
- Exactly.

52
00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:02.060
- And he came back with version 1.

53
00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.060
- Right. And if you're working in an agile team

54
00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.080
you don't have versions typically,

55
00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.020
because you are always, you know,

56
00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.040
there's nothing to show you

57
00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.070
because you've been there the whole time.

58
00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:15.040
And so the product owner will be,

59
00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.070
you know, typically, if you're on a scrum team

60
00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.060
this is called the product owner or the customer,

61
00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.070
will typically be sort of interacting with the team

62
00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:21.080
in real time at all times.

63
00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.030
- So that's really different

64
00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:24.060
to conventional project management

65
00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.060
where you almost want to keep the customer at arm's length,

66
00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.060
because you don't want the customer to see

67
00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.030
some of the problems that you have

68
00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:32.040
and you don't want the customer

69
00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.000
to keep messing around and changing the spec.

70
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.090
- Yeah.

71
00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:36.090
And you just want to get a really clear brief

72
00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.020
and then be left alone to get on with it.

73
00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.050
And also you might be some things that are secret.

74
00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.070
You don't want the customer to know how you do them,

75
00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:47.000
so that's really, really different.

76
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.070
- XP teams call it "embracing change."

77
00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.070
So instead of saying," Okay, I don't want to

78
00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:53.060
interact with my customer because they might change things

79
00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.080
and I've got a lot invested in this the way that it is,"

80
00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.090
instead you're like, "Give me changes

81
00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.010
because I know that the more I change,

82
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.000
the more likely that I'm going to meet your expectations."
