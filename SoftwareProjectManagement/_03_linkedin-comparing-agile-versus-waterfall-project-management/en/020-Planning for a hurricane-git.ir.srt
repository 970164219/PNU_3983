1
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:06.090
- [Doug] Sure!

2
00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:09.070
which is, I was talking to someone else about Agile

3
00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:13.080
the other day, it's all I talk about nowadays, and

4
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.060
he was saying that

5
00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:20.000
there's a thing called the Cone of Uncertainty

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.050
or whatever and as time goes on,

7
00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.000
you home in more and more on what you're making

8
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.050
and what you like and what you want,

9
00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:29.090
but he said that's not true, because actually,

10
00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:31.060
every time you make a decision,

11
00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.020
you close off other options.

12
00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.090
So the example he gave me was,

13
00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:39.030
Suppose you're driving in an Agile way,

14
00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.020
towards a destination.

15
00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.040
And you don't have a map, because the Gantt chart

16
00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.080
is like an overall map of how we're going to get there,

17
00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:48.010
but the problem is, sometimes roads are closed and things

18
00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:49.040
so the argument is,

19
00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.040
because the map may not be 100% accurate,

20
00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.040
we won't have a map at all.

21
00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.050
This is kind of, this is what I think Agile people are doing

22
00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:57.070
in a way, they're saying, well,

23
00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.070
because something might change, let's just not,

24
00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.010
let's make it up as we go along, almost.

25
00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:02.090
- We'll get somewhere.

26
00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:03.080
- And as long as we got a compass

27
00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.020
and we're going roughly the right direction,

28
00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:06.010
- Yeah.

29
00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:07.090
- and actually, I have noticed with my SatNav,

30
00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:09.090
that if a road is closed, it just says,

31
00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.020
well, okay, take this one instead,

32
00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.030
and it adds almost no time, it says,

33
00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:15.020
because this road is closed,

34
00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.050
your journey is going to be one minute longer.

35
00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:18.090
And you think well, that's interesting,

36
00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.060
because I had my optimized route,

37
00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:21.070
but actually all the other routes,

38
00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:23.030
they're not much different, really.

39
00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:24.070
So I do take that point.

40
00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.020
So, anyway, he said that if you're applying this to sort of

41
00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.090
just head west,

42
00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.040
and kind of make it up as you go along,

43
00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.010
and every junction just decide,

44
00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:34.070
which is more the Agile approach,

45
00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.090
he said there's a flaw in that.

46
00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.000
Because what if you're going along next to a river?

47
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.090
And it's only a small river, so it's not a problem,

48
00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.000
and you go, and there's the river,

49
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.070
and then there's a bridge across the river, and you think

50
00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.060
because you don't have a map, you're doing Agile,

51
00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.000
you think, Shall I go across the bridge or not?

52
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.030
The bridge has a little, a small cost,

53
00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:54.090
and you think I won't, I'll, you know,

54
00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.040
I don't need to cross the river yet.

55
00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.050
And you carry along, and later on you discover that

56
00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:00.040
that was the last bridge.

57
00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.020
And you're now on the wrong side of this,

58
00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:03.060
of the Mississippi,

59
00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.040
and you're thinking Oh, no!

60
00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.050
New Orleans is the other side of the Mississippi,

61
00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:08.090
I'm screwed!

62
00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.080
And so is there not a risk, when you do Agile,

63
00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:17.030
that later you're going to regret decisions you made earlier?

64
00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.000
And then have to chuck it out.

65
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.010
Maybe that's just the risk you run for being more flexible.

66
00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.010
But, you know, wouldn't a map have been better?

67
00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.060
A map/Gantt chart have been better?

68
00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.000
(laughing)

69
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.090
- I almost want to make a Gantt chart together now.

70
00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.060
The issue is that, if you were going to,

71
00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.020
if you were going to use a map,

72
00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.000
like you said with your Google maps,

73
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
then you run into the challenge of, like you said,

74
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.080
a closed road.

75
00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.060
So, but a lot of times you don't figure out that

76
00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.040
that road is closed, until very late into the project.

77
00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.070
And that's what the Cone of Uncertainty is,

78
00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.090
is that if you, like,

79
00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.090
I spend a lot of time in Florida, the States,

80
00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.000
which is very nice.

81
00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.020
And so they have, you know, hurricanes that come up,

82
00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:59.020
every so often.

83
00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:01.040
And so when you're sitting in Florida, and they say

84
00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.020
Oh, there's a hurricane.

85
00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:03.080
There's always beautiful weather before a hurricane.

86
00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.080
And then always like, you know,

87
00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.040
the hurricane's going to hit anywhere

88
00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.080
from Fort Lauderdale to Miami.

89
00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.010
Which if you know Florida, is like 100 miles, you know,

90
00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:11.090
I mean.

91
00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.050
- But it gets more precise as the whole thing gets closer.

92
00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:14.060
- Exactly.

93
00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.050
And so if you can't, if I decided that, you know,

94
00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:21.080
I was going to run and start, dig a hole and, you know,

95
00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:23.060
store up a bunch of Pop-Tarts and beer,

96
00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:28.000
which is what Floridians buy when there's a hurricane,

97
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:35.000
then, you know, I may have wasted a lot of effort

98
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.040
is that, as you go further along,

99
00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.080
the cost of change becomes much greater.

100
00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:44.020
And so, it's depending on where your road is closed.

101
00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:46.070
If your road is closed at the very end,

102
00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:49.000
really close to where you were supposed to,

103
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.050
where you wanted to go,

104
00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:52.040
then you could kind of end up screwed.

105
00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.000
Because you just invested a lot of money

106
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.070
to get 90% of the way there.

107
00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:58.070
But with an Agile approach,

108
00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:01.000
what you're doing is that you're breaking things up,

109
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.010
work up, into little sprint, and so you are

110
00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:06.060
reevaluating every stop or,

111
00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.050
- But you don't look very far ahead, do you?

112
00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:09.090
You're only looking,

113
00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.030
There's the road closures, and then there's the river

114
00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.010
that's there originally,

115
00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:15.080
and I'm just thinking, with Agile,

116
00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:18.050
you never look further ahead than that two weeks,

117
00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:20.060
you aren't, you just constantly just,

118
00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:23.010
you know, like, looking at a tiny bit of your map each time

119
00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:25.050
and thinking oh, I didn't see that over there!

120
00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.020
I mean, that's what worries me about it.

121
00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.080
Or is there somehow a bigger visibility, as well?

122
00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.010
- No, I think that whether or not you're working with

123
00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:35.010
the deterministic approach, or Agile,

124
00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:37.060
you're always going to be working with imperfect information.

125
00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:38.040
- [Chris] Yeah.

126
00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:41.020
So, if you use a deterministic approach,

127
00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:45.080
you can have a lot of projects that are failed projects

128
00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.030
when you've already invested 80% of the resources

129
00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:49.020
that you need to get there,

130
00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:52.030
which is like the road being closed near the end.

131
00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:55.070
But, and I don't know that the information that you'd get

132
00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:58.060
from a deterministic approach would let you know about

133
00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:01.050
the bridge going across the river before,

134
00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:03.090
you know, if you're not sort of getting that information.

135
00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:05.070
- And my map could be wrong, it might say there's a bridge

136
00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:08.030
and when you get there, there isn't.

137
00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:09.080
But I still think a map, you know, a rough,

138
00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.000
- You'll at least be able to drive down the countryside now.

139
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.060
- Yeah, but I sort of think a rough map

140
00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:16.000
is always better than no map.

141
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.030
But I think maybe what it boils down to is

142
00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:21.020
how much work is involved in the planning,

143
00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:24.010
like if the map is really expensive, you know,

144
00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:26.000
like takes ages to plan your Gantt chart,

145
00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.030
then you might think I should just not bother with a map,

146
00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:29.060
and let's just go Agile. - [Doug] Yeah.

147
00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:32.040
Or, you know, if it's going to cost a lot of time and money

148
00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:35.010
to bury your Pop-Tarts and, what was the other thing?

149
00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:36.050
- Beer. - Beer, oh yeah,

150
00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:37.030
forgot the beer.

151
00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:39.030
So, if it's going to cost a lot of money to do that,

152
00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:40.090
you might think, well, let's wait until the hurricane

153
00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:42.060
gets really near, and then do it.

154
00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:45.060
And I think there is an assumption amongst Agile people

155
00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:48.000
that the Waterfall is a lot of work,

156
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.080
to do the planning up front, and therefore

157
00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:52.030
not worth it, since things will change anyway.

158
00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:56.000
And, actually, I think often people do spend

159
00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.070
far too much time,

160
00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:59.090
and they've got really laborious processes,

161
00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:02.080
and lots of horrible Microsoft project Gantt chart,

162
00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:05.050
which I hate, and all that, and I think

163
00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:07.060
you know, personally, maybe the answer is,

164
00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:09.090
is a really quick, easy Gantt chart.

165
00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:12.010
Just a rough Gantt chart, I mean, why would you not have

166
00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:15.050
just an approximate plan of what you think's going to happen,

167
00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:17.030
and then at least you can see whether you're kind of

168
00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:20.040
on schedule or not, and, you know, maybe that's the answer.

169
00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:23.090
- If it feels right, but the problem is that it's,

170
00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:25.080
with a Gantt chart, you're just,

171
00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:28.010
there's nothing for you to record an Agile project.

172
00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:29.060
So it'd be empty. - You literally couldn't

173
00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:30.050
mix the two.

174
00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:31.070
- Right, well, it's not that you couldn't mix it,

175
00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:34.010
it's just like, it, you know, it's like,

176
00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:37.050
having a map when you're trying to cook muffins.

177
00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:39.050
And so, it's just a different, you know,

178
00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:42.040
it's like a different sort of,

179
00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:46.080
you're using kind of a different sort of report

180
00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:48.020
for something that you need.

181
00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:49.090
And, you know, with Agile, there's just,

182
00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:52.060
you wouldn't be able to put anything into a Gantt chart.

183
00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:55.090
Because, again, you could pivot and change,

184
00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:58.020
so there's no way to measure out all the dependencies,

185
00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:01.060
and there's no way to figure out when you're going to deliver

186
00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:02.050
what you're going to deliver,

187
00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:03.080
because you can't manage the dependencies,

188
00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:05.090
because you don't know what it's going to be at the end.

189
00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:07.030
And so, - Oh, I'm feeling anxious

190
00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:08.020
again. - I know.

191
00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:09.070
So you really couldn't, there's nothing,

192
00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:11.020
so it'd just be an empty Gantt chart.

193
00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:12.050
What I would do is just create a burndown chart

194
00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:14.040
and just call it a Gantt chart.

195
00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:18.000
And so, it's, there's just no, there's no,

196
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
wouldn't be any information to sort of,

197
00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.060
to put into it, and so it would just be kind of

198
00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:24.080
a bunch of boxes and at the end you would say,

199
00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:26.000
Something will get delivered here.
