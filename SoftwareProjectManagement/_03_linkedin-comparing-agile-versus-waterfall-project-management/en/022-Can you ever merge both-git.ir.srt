1
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.060
- I think we know the answer to this one now

2
00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:09.020
but could you ever use a mixture

3
00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:11.090
or are the two things so different

4
00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:16.060
that there'd be no benefit to doing a bit of each?

5
00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:19.010
- That actually, sadly that's the most common

6
00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:23.020
way to do it, because most teams will say

7
00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:25.070
we'd love to run as an Agile team, but man,

8
00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:28.030
we've got a plan that we received from whatever,

9
00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:30.000
and we need to follow it, so we'll

10
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.020
just use a little bit of both.

11
00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:33.010
And Agile--

12
00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:34.050
- And they do that, they use both?

13
00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.070
- It's bad.

14
00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.070
- Yeah, from this conversation, I can't imagine

15
00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:38.080
how you could use both.

16
00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:41.000
- It's bad.

17
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.020
And then they call it, you know,

18
00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:43.020
it's a ScrumBut.

19
00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.010
We to everything Scrum, but this.

20
00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:47.060
AgileFall, you know, there's a bunch

21
00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:49.070
of different terms for it.

22
00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:53.050
But it's, to me when you mix these two approaches

23
00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.070
you get kind of the worst of both worlds.

24
00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.050
Because you spend a lot of time planning

25
00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.050
at the beginning, but then your team is free

26
00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:00.080
to throw away that plan.

27
00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:01.070
- So this is where,

28
00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.070
So the next year you'd have a Gantt Chart,

29
00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.010
and each stage of the Gantt Chart

30
00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.000
you'd do in an Agile way, sort of thing.

31
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.050
But I can see that would be awful.

32
00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:10.090
- It would be, but it's the most popular, unfortunately.

33
00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:14.010
That's what most teams do, some variation of that.

34
00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.070
- So it's true Agile, or nothing.

35
00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.010
- I wouldn't say true Agile or nothing,

36
00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.090
but I would say it--

37
00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.080
- Well, true Agile or not Agile at all.

38
00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.010
By nothing, I mean Waterfall.

39
00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.090
You caught me there.

40
00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.090
- Everybody does something.

41
00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.080
I would say that if you understand the benefits

42
00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.020
of each approach, make a decision,

43
00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.010
and then move with it.

44
00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:33.080
You're much better off doing a Waterfall,

45
00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.070
or a deterministic approach, and then doing it well,

46
00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.060
than you are doing a mixed approach poorly.

47
00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:41.080
And you're much better off, obviously,

48
00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.080
I think, doing an Agile approach well

49
00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.070
than either for software,

50
00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.060
but I've been to many organizations

51
00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.030
where they say, well we want to become Agile

52
00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.080
but we still want our plans,

53
00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.080
our manager still wants milestones,

54
00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.050
and I say well, you could do something Agile-ish.

55
00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:01.000
Maybe put up a kanban board, or something like that

56
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:01.090
but you're not going to really get

57
00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.060
that much benefit from it.

58
00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.030
So you really have to embrace the idea

59
00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.090
of doing iterative and incremental delivery,

60
00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.000
and getting feedback from your customer

61
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.040
and delivering something every two weeks.

62
00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.010
That's another huge challenge.

63
00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.090
- So if you were a big senior manager,

64
00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.040
and you had a whole load of projects going on,

65
00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.090
in, say, your IT department or whatever

66
00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.040
of this big company.

67
00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.020
On the plus side, you'd see things

68
00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:25.070
delivered every two weeks,

69
00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:28.010
but on the minus side, you wouldn't

70
00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.040
really have a big overall plan of what was going on.

71
00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.020
You wouldn't have what I dream of,

72
00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:34.050
which is a Gantt of Gantts.

73
00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.020
I like to see all the projects.

74
00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:37.080
We're going to do this project, then this one,

75
00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.060
then this one, and I can see that's

76
00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.090
half-finished, as indeed it should be,

77
00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.020
and you wouldn't have any of that,

78
00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.000
so it's really down to trust and enpowerment,

79
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.000
and that sort of stuff.

80
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.020
But you can at least see a little bit's been delivered.

81
00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:52.020
- Yeah, I would say you can trust them less,

82
00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.070
because you're looking at it in real time.

83
00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:56.030
I would say that you have to trust people

84
00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:57.080
more when you do a Gantt Chart.

85
00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.020
Because the Gantt Chart's beautiful.

86
00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:00.070
I mean I used to be a project manager, too.

87
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.020
It's beautiful, you look at it,

88
00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:04.060
but the thing that hurts your heart

89
00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:05.070
when you make a beautiful Gantt Chart

90
00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.080
is it always, someone always screws it up.

91
00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.040
I know, it's, it's--

92
00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.000
- But I don't mind if my Gantt Chart,

93
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.060
well, I do mind, but it gets adjusted slightly

94
00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.040
and this has run late, so we have to

95
00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.030
squeeze this down just to finish on time,

96
00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:21.030
or whatever.

97
00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.020
But I still feel I'm always in control

98
00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:25.060
as I keep re-jigging my Gantt Chart.

99
00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.060
You know, I can see as I run my marathon

100
00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.040
that I was a bit slow on the first half,

101
00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.090
I'm going to have to speed up on the second half,

102
00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.050
but I still know where I am,

103
00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:34.040
and even if I'm heading to finish

104
00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.030
five minutes late,

105
00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:38.020
I'm not going to ever run a marathon (laughs)

106
00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:41.030
but, you know, in theory I can see, I can tell you

107
00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:42.070
half-way round that I'm going to finish

108
00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:43.060
five minutes late.

109
00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.050
So I still feel in control, even if

110
00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:47.070
I'm overspending or running late.

111
00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:49.030
- Yeah, and I would totally get that,

112
00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:51.020
but I would argue that you are

113
00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:53.090
in better control of your schedule,

114
00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:55.060
but I would argue that Agile teams are

115
00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.000
in better control of the product.

116
00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.070
Because you're delivering at every two weeks.

117
00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:02.020
- But they don't know whether they're going to

118
00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:05.070
deliver seven out of ten of the options, or nine.

119
00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:06.060
- It's up to the customer.

120
00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.040
- But then those last few are things

121
00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.000
you're not too bothered about, anyway.

122
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.020
- If you're delivering the highest value first,

123
00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:13.090
they should be lowest value stuff.

124
00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:15.090
So you always, you're going to do a house

125
00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:17.070
you always end with the dog house.

126
00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.000
Not that I'm not a dog lover.
