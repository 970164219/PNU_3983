1
00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.060
- Okay, so that makes sense.

2
00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:09.040
Now, it's divided into these,

3
00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:13.090
you were saying inflexible two week sprints.

4
00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:16.000
Wouldn't life be great if you could divide

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.090
everything up into exact, two week chunks?

6
00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.040
But I'm thinking, what if it's a four week job,

7
00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:23.050
or a one week?

8
00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:25.020
I suppose if it's one week, do you just deliver

9
00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:27.080
two one weeks within your sprint?

10
00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:31.040
I mean, how does everything get wedged into

11
00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.090
a two week chunk?

12
00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:34.090
- Yeah, that's the inflexible part of Scrum,

13
00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:39.070
is that you have to deliver what your product

14
00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:43.070
owner requests at the top of the product backlog

15
00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:44.050
every two weeks.

16
00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.000
And sometimes if the product owner,

17
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.030
you'll have to work with them to break something down.

18
00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.030
So like, if the product owner, let's say that

19
00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.090
they want, like, a webpage at the end of the sprint.

20
00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.080
So you might say to them, "Okay, what's the most

21
00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.020
"valuable part of the webpage?"

22
00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.020
And they might say, "Well this is, you know,

23
00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:02.000
"I want a form where people can submit their information."

24
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.060
And then I would say, "Okay, well we can't create

25
00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:04.070
"the whole form in two weeks,

26
00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.010
"so what's the most valuable part of the form?"

27
00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:08.030
And they'd say, "What I really need is their

28
00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.000
"email address and their first name."

29
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.040
And so, at the end of two weeks, our team would deliver

30
00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.060
a webpage that just comes up with two boxes

31
00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.090
that just say first name, email address.

32
00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.090
But the key thing to keep in mind is that

33
00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.030
that webpage will be the same webpage

34
00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.010
that's in the final product.

35
00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:27.060
It will completely work.

36
00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.080
It will be going to a database, it will be backed up.

37
00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.020
It will be optimized.

38
00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:34.090
- So you can't be halfway through something

39
00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:35.070
at the end of your sprint.

40
00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.080
That's got to be something that works

41
00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.020
at the end of every sprint.

42
00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:40.060
- And that's one of the biggest challenges

43
00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.080
for new Scrum teams, is they'll just say,

44
00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.020
they'll put up something like a UX UI drawing.

45
00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.070
And they'll be like, "And next week, this will work."

46
00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:50.050
You know?

47
00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:51.060
"In our next sprint, this will work."

48
00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.040
And you can't do that in Scrum.

49
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.060
It's cheating.

50
00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:56.040
So.

51
00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.000
- But I guess with enough thinking it might

52
00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.070
be possible to divide everything down

53
00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.020
into working pieces of two week size.

54
00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.030
I don't know, it seems like, in a way,

55
00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.020
an unnecessary constraint to put on yourself.

56
00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:09.040
Because it, on a Gantt chart,

57
00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:11.070
something might be a week, it might be three weeks.

58
00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:13.080
Whatever it is, we put it on there.

59
00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.010
And then at the end of the three weeks,

60
00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.060
or the one week, we say, "Have you done it?"

61
00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.000
But it's kind of odd that they've just chosen this,

62
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.050
I mean, two weeks is a good amount of time.

63
00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:24.070
I get that.

64
00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:27.060
But that is quite a constraint to have put on yourself.

65
00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.090
- That's what I meant when I said I think

66
00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.010
that style is much more, sort of,

67
00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.000
chaotic and flexible to me.

68
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.070
Because I think to myself, well, you know,

69
00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:38.040
it could take two weeks or three weeks.

70
00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.020
So what happens to the person downstream,

71
00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:42.030
because then they have to take into

72
00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.030
account your variability?

73
00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.030
And so then you just put in a bunch of little buffers

74
00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.000
and things like that to try to make it all work,

75
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.040
which completely makes sense.

76
00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.060
But for software, it can get into a lot of trouble that way

77
00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.020
because you can end up with, you don't want to have,

78
00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:59.040
you know, obviously you wouldn't want that

79
00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.060
with a ship, as well.

80
00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.000
You wouldn't want to have like 3/4 of a hull done.

81
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.030
But with software, there's an old joke in software

82
00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.060
that software developers are like 90% finished

83
00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.070
90% of the time.

84
00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:11.050
(chuckling) - Yeah.

85
00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:13.040
- And so, and that's true, and so you force them

86
00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.010
to sort of deliver a sprint,

87
00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:16.090
deliver a working product increment

88
00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.080
at the end of every sprint.

89
00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.080
- Well I must say, my experience with software guys

90
00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.000
is it would have been great to have nailed them down

91
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.020
to at least finishing something by a certain date,

92
00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:28.080
so I totally get that.

93
00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.000
- That's why managers like Scrum, typically.
