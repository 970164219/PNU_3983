00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.050
- You mentioned burn down charts earlier on.

2
00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:11.010
That's another of the buzz words that,

3
00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.020
Agile is so full of buzz words.

4
00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:14.020
- Yeah.

5
00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:17.070
- But, you know, that makes it exciting for people,

6
00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.020
and harder to assess.

7
00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.000
(laughs)

8
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.050
But burn down charts, are they really just a budget?

9
00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.060
I suppose it's got a timeline,

10
00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.040
so you can look at the angle of it,

11
00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:32.010
but is it really just looking at your expenditure rate

12
00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:34.020
and saying, if we carry on at the current rate,

13
00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.000
this is when we're going to run out of money?

14
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.050
Is that all it is, or is there more to it than that?

15
00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.080
- It doesn't directly have to do with money,

16
00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:45.040
because you have two typical, two burn down charts

17
00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.090
in a Scrum team.

18
00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.050
You'll have the Sprint burn down,

19
00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.090
which will be the number of user stories.

20
00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.060
Which is basically sort of doing the same thing

21
00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:57.010
as the task board, it's just showing how much of the tasks

22
00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.020
are being burned down to meet the bottom,

23
00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.000
which will be the Sprint review.

24
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.080
Because, again, in Scrum it's inflexible,

25
00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.000
you have to deliver something in two weeks.

26
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.030
You can't just stand up there and be like,

27
00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.060
well, you know, sorry.

28
00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.070
It's December and so we.

29
00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.010
So you have to deliver what you commit to delivering

30
00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:18.080
at the end of the Sprint.

31
00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.070
But then you have a release burn down,

32
00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:23.070
which is a little bit more sophisticated.

33
00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.000
Where you and I would sit together and we were doing

34
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.050
an Agile product, and I would say to you,

35
00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:32.020
how many Sprints worth of work can you afford?

36
00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:38.040
I have five developers that cost me $250,000 a Sprint,

37
00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.090
you have a budget of whatever.

38
00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.050
So we'll go through and we'll figure out

39
00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:46.040
when we're going to be done delivering something.

40
00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.010
So we'll have like 20 Sprints or whatever,

41
00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:53.020
and we'll burn down the work that the product owner

42
00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.050
identifies until we release at the end of that,

43
00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.060
you know, whatever.

44
00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.010
- But it's not a Gantt chart because we don't know

45
00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:02.080
what we're going to be doing at each time.

46
00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.080
Because a Gantt chart will tell you

47
00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.090
what you're going to spend when, and what you'll get for it.

48
00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.040
But with this we just know that's the rate

49
00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:09.030
that the monies going to be going at.

50
00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.020
- That's how many Sprints you can afford.

51
00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:12.030
- Yeah.

52
00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.000
- And Gantt charts also manage dependencies.
