00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:06.020
- Okay, so Doug, to start with

2
00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:09.070
for those who don't know, what is Agile?

3
00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:12.040
- All right, thanks Chris.

4
00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.040
Agile is typically, talking about the Agile manifesto.

5
00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:19.090
So the Agile manifesto came out in 2001.

6
00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:23.030
It actually Scrum, extreme programming

7
00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:25.060
which are different frameworks that you use

8
00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.090
when you're working on an Agile product

9
00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:31.050
actually preceded the Agile manifesto.

10
00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.030
- Okay.

11
00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:33.010
- So all these guys got together

12
00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.030
and they said, we're doing something very similar,

13
00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.020
let's come up with a name for it.

14
00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.090
And so they came up with the term Agile.

15
00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.010
So Agile is typically anything that's consistent

16
00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.000
any way that you're developing a product

17
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.060
that's consistent with the Agile manifesto.

18
00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:52.090
And so the Agile manifesto is a list of core values

19
00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:54.080
and if the work that you're doing

20
00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.000
is consistent with the Agile Manifesto,

21
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.030
then you're working sort of as an Agile team.

22
00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.000
- Okay, and is the real essence of the Agile Manifesto

23
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
that you're not locked into a plan from the start

24
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.020
but you can vary it as you go along.

25
00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:09.080
Or is that just what I've pulled out of it

26
00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.040
from looking at it.

27
00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.030
- Agile puts less emphasis on planning

28
00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.060
and more emphasis on adapting to change.

29
00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:21.070
And so you are not planning out a project

30
00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:23.030
like you would in project management,

31
00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.080
not looking at everything that your project will deliver,

32
00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.060
instead your planning in much smaller chunks.

33
00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.010
And you're sort of building up a product that way

34
00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:34.090
by doing these really short-term plans.

35
00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:35.070
- Okay, great.

36
00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.020
So I understand that.

37
00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.000
Next I want to explore that in a bit more detail.
