1
00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:08.070
I've been so looking forward to asking you all this stuff.

2
00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:10.060
I got this great big old list of questions,

3
00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:13.070
and one of my questions it was,

4
00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:17.020
I bet you have a Gantt chart really, you know.

5
00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:18.090
So when you're doing an Agile project,

6
00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.040
and you say, well, we're just going to do this,

7
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.080
build this room and then this room

8
00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:32.090
and then we see how it goes and maybe,

9
00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.090
or secretly on a piece of paper, have a rough plan of

10
00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:40.040
what's going to happen or do you really, every two weeks go,

11
00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.020
"Okay guys where are we at?

12
00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:43.070
"What should we do for the next two weeks?"

13
00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.030
I mean do you, is that really what you do?

14
00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.010
- I secretly Gantt at night and so,

15
00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.010
but it's, the Gantt chart is different, you know,

16
00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.060
Gantt charts are great and

17
00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.070
Henry Gantt, whatever, he created them

18
00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.080
to do really big projects,

19
00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.040
you know, like the Hoover Dam

20
00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.020
and I think he was a shipbuilder or worked in shipbuilding.

21
00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.000
And so it's designed for manufacturing,

22
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.020
really big manufacturing project.

23
00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.030
- Although I would have a Gantt chart

24
00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:09.090
even for something quite small,

25
00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.080
just saying, because they're so quick to draw,

26
00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.080
so people say to me, at what time,

27
00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.070
sorry I'm interrupting but people say,

28
00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.030
"At what point does something become a project?

29
00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.050
"What time is it worth planning?"

30
00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:24.040
And I would say if you've got more than about 10 tasks

31
00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.090
or if you've got two or three people involved,

32
00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.000
it's worth having a bit of a plan of who's doing what

33
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.080
and everybody can then see what their part is.

34
00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.040
And so I think even for something really small it's well.

35
00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.070
And that's why I just find it so weird

36
00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.060
that even for quite, you know, just a smallish Agile project

37
00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.070
there isn't secretly some kind of Gantt,

38
00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.060
(crosstalk)

39
00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.060
kind of telling me how

40
00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.030
you really don't have, - I haven't seen it

41
00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.050
but maybe there's a secret Gantter out there

42
00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.010
on one of the teams, but

43
00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:50.080
what a Gantt chart records

44
00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.080
isn't information that's available

45
00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.050
for an Agile or Scrum team.

46
00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.080
And so, because, remember, you know the Gantt chart,

47
00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.050
the whole reason that they do the Gantt chart is so that

48
00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:00.080
you can build the hull of the ship

49
00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.010
before you build the top of the ship.

50
00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:04.030
You can build the house, you know,

51
00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.070
start with the slats, and then move away into cement,

52
00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:08.020
and whatsit, showing dependencies.

53
00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.000
- But you do have an order you're going to do it in.

54
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
I know you're doing the most valuable thing first,

55
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.020
but I mean, there is, you know you're going to do the kitchen

56
00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.070
before the bathroom, and you know when you do the kitchen

57
00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:20.090
you're going to have to do, you know, the cooker,

58
00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.070
and the floor, and, so you kind of know the order.

59
00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:27.000
- The only way that you could ever use a Gantt chart,

60
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.020
I think, successfully in an Agile/Scrum project or product,

61
00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:34.040
is that if you have the team create a two-week Gantt,

62
00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.020
each sprint.

63
00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:36.030
- [Chris] Okay.

64
00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.050
- And so, but, again, you know, it's,

65
00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.020
- Well, you don't need that, because it's only two weeks.

66
00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.060
- Right, and the way that a Gantt chart extends

67
00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.020
off into time,

68
00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.030
kind of like, you know, you can just go horizontally

69
00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.090
forever until the product, the project is finished,

70
00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.080
is something that would be very disorienting for,

71
00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.060
I think, a good Scrum team, because,

72
00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.030
that's why typically Scrum teams use a burndown chart,

73
00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.080
is because you're burning down the work, yeah,

74
00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.070
you're burning down the work, until you have nothing left.

75
00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:07.030
And so it's not a continuum of work that you're managing,

76
00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.040
and then you're delivering at a certain time.

77
00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.040
You're burning down your work based on the highest value,

78
00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.060
until there's nothing.

79
00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.010
And so, but you wouldn't, remember, like, in Gantt,

80
00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.080
you're trying to plan out an entire project.

81
00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.020
I mean, that's the real value in it,

82
00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:23.040
is that, you know, you're doing the dependencies

83
00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.040
and things like that, but,

84
00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.030
with a Scrum team, Agile team, you're not running a project.

85
00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:31.090
You're building up a product, and so you're doing this

86
00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.070
iterative and incremental delivery.

87
00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:35.020
- But to build that product,

88
00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:36.070
I'm just sticking to my house analogy,

89
00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:39.070
even though I know you wouldn't use Agile for a house, but,

90
00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:42.080
to do that product, you know it's got certain rooms,

91
00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.090
and you know there's work within those rooms,

92
00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.020
and you've decided on the order of the rooms,

93
00:03:48.020 --> 00:05:42.040
because you're going to do them starting with

94
00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:47.020
And so, Scrum was based on sort of this empirical process

95
00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:48.010
they met with, actually,

96
00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:49.080
a chemist in University of Wisconsin,

97
00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:52.050
where they focused on using an empirical approach

98
00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:53.030
to deliver software.

99
00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:54.090
You're doing an experiment, like,

100
00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:56.030
- Sort of like research and development,

101
00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:58.000
where we're just gradually trying things,

102
00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.060
developing, you know, a new drug or whatever it might be,

103
00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:01.080
a medical drug. - Pharmaceuticals,

104
00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:02.080
or things like that. - Yeah.

105
00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:04.030
- Or is it like manufacturing,

106
00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:06.090
where you're, like, delivering, you know, shoes,

107
00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:11.010
or delivering, you know, a car, or something like that.

108
00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:14.070
So is it, now a lot of people who work on software products

109
00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:15.080
think it's more like science.

110
00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:18.050
More like, you know, pharmaceutical research,

111
00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:20.050
because when they can pivot, they'll learn something new,

112
00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:21.090
they can create something new,

113
00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:23.090
and they don't know that much when they start.

114
00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:25.090
And some people think it's more like manufacturing.

115
00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:27.040
- I really, I am really glad you said that,

116
00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:29.000
'cause that's something that I've been thinking for a while,

117
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.060
because I, when teaching people product management,

118
00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:34.070
I say to them that everything you do is either a project

119
00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:36.050
or a process.

120
00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:38.080
So you've got projects which have a start and a finish,

121
00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:40.090
and you're going to build something and there it is,

122
00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:43.060
and then you've got processes that go on forever.

123
00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:46.070
And so, you know, I've come from running factories,

124
00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:49.020
and you can probably tell by my whole mindset,

125
00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:52.010
so in a factory, it's mostly processes that just roll along,

126
00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:55.050
but you have the occasional project where you

127
00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:59.030
improve a process, or you install a new production line,

128
00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:01.010
a new product line or whatever,

129
00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:03.070
and then that's a project, and I always loved the projects

130
00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:05.080
because that feels like progress in the end,

131
00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:07.070
where you do something new.

132
00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:11.010
So in my sort of mindset, you've got processes that go on

133
00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:13.010
forever, and then you've got projects.

134
00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:17.050
But of course, you've got things that are in between.

135
00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:22.020
So quality improvement is sort of a process

136
00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:24.040
that consists of lots of little projects,

137
00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:29.070
and coming up with new products over the years.

138
00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:31.040
You know, your product evolves,

139
00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:33.050
and is that a project or a process?

140
00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:36.070
And I wonder whether Agile sort of sits in that area

141
00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:37.050
in between.

142
00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:40.010
It's not really pure project management, in a way,

143
00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:42.070
it's more to do with processes and having, you know,

144
00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:43.080
great communication,

145
00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:47.030
and good communication with the customer.

146
00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:52.030
So it's more like a process, although it does have a finish.

147
00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:53.060
And there is a burndown chart,

148
00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:55.040
and there's money running out.

149
00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:58.030
But it's more like, for me, it's more like a process

150
00:07:58.030 --> 00:07:59.060
than a project.

151
00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:02.000
- Yeah, I mean, I would think of it more like, just like,

152
00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.010
product delivery,

153
00:08:03.010 --> 00:08:06.000
instead of just like an ongoing forever process.

154
00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.030
You know, in project management,

155
00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:10.010
you'll have your scope tied down,

156
00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:13.080
some sense of sort of like, the, you know, the time,

157
00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:17.020
then of course because you have time, you have the cost,

158
00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:21.000
and with using a Scrum/Agile approach,

159
00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.010
then you don't really have the, you know, you don't,

160
00:08:25.010 --> 00:08:26.080
you have a little bit of the scope,

161
00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:28.000
but not in the same way that you have

162
00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.020
with project management, because with project management

163
00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:32.030
you have the scope, which is both what it will do,

164
00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:35.010
and how you will deliver it, somewhat.

165
00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:40.030
But you don't have, you have the time, and you have the cost

166
00:08:40.030 --> 00:08:44.030
but those are not tied down, like an iron triangle.

167
00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:46.030
They kind of, and a lot of times what you'll hear about Agile

168
00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:47.080
is it sort of flips it on its head.

169
00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:50.020
The way that I like to think of it is that

170
00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:51.070
instead of having a triangle,

171
00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:56.020
where you have sort of scope, cost, you know, and time,

172
00:08:56.020 --> 00:09:00.000
you flip it over, and then you fill up an Agile product

173
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.010
with as much scope as your customer wants.

174
00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:03.050
- Until you run out of money.

175
00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:05.040
- Yep, until your time and your money run out.

176
00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:09.080
- Yeah, and with my app, I actually didn't have

177
00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:12.060
a fixed amount of money, we didn't go 'til my money ran out,

178
00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:14.010
I just spent more.

179
00:09:14.010 --> 00:09:16.000
And I was fine with that, 'cause I thought,

180
00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.030
you know, it's not costing me that much,

181
00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:19.040
and if I have to pay a bit more to have the app I want,

182
00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:20.020
I will.

183
00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:22.010
And if I have to wait a bit longer, I will.

184
00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:23.070
And I think Agile's really great

185
00:09:23.070 --> 00:09:25.080
when you're not quite sure what you want,

186
00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:27.070
you don't really care what it costs,

187
00:09:27.070 --> 00:09:29.080
and you don't really care how long it takes.

188
00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:32.020
And actually, I think quite a lot of projects are like that.

189
00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:33.090
My app was like that.

190
00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:36.070
But I think if I was, you know, doing something bigger,

191
00:09:36.070 --> 00:09:39.050
then there might be a date when it must be done by,

192
00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:43.020
and there might be a budget that I really can't go beyond,

193
00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:46.030
and then it would be less good.

194
00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:48.090
- Almost all Agile products, almost all Scrum projects

195
00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:50.040
I work on with a team and Agile mindset

196
00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:53.030
has a very set cost,

197
00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:55.010
and so, - okay, so, it's how many

198
00:09:55.010 --> 00:09:56.060
features can you get for that cost?

199
00:09:56.060 --> 00:09:57.000
- Exactly.
