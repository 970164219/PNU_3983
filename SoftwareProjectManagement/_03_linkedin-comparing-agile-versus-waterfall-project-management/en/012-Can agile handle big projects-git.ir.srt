1
00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:06.080
- And something else I've got on my list to ask is,

2
00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:11.020
when projects get bigger, my gut feeling is

3
00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:13.040
that if you're going to do something really big,

4
00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.040
you wouldn't use Agile because you couldn't

5
00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.030
keep control of it.

6
00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:18.070
You know, as a Waterfall person,

7
00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:20.040
I'm a control freak, so I want to know

8
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:24.080
what's the plan? Are we on schedule? Who's doing what?

9
00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.010
And Agile just feels horribly out of control to me.

10
00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:32.010
So, do you think that there's a limit to the size

11
00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:35.090
of project you could use Agile on?

12
00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.040
- I think that, yes.

13
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.000
I think that it's a big challenge

14
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.080
kind of in the Agile community, and so they came out with

15
00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.030
a bunch of frameworks, so scaled edge frameworks

16
00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:48.050
- I've seen, Safe, yeah, the scaled Agile frame.

17
00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.020
And I looked at that, in Google Images

18
00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:55.010
and, whoa, it was this horrendous, but I mean, does it work?

19
00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:56.070
Or could it work?

20
00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.000
- Well, you know there's Safe, that's Dean Leffingwell

21
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.010
you know, there's Less, there's stuff coming out of

22
00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.030
you know, Scott, I forgot his last name

23
00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.070
but he comes out of IBM, he's got a scaled edge,

24
00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.000
a Discipline Agile, which is another sort of scaling

25
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.090
Agile framework. And, so-

26
00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.080
- Clearly, if a management consultant could crack it

27
00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.040
they'd make a load of money.

28
00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.020
So there is an incentive to scale Agile, but is that

29
00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.070
basically trying to make

30
00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.040
a pig into an elephant, or something?

31
00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.090
I mean, is it impossible?

32
00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.080
- It's a challenge, because I think that, you know,

33
00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.090
you have your organization set up for silos, and so

34
00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.000
scaled Agile, or a lot of the scaling frameworks come in

35
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.010
Less is a little bit different,

36
00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:41.050
but they come in, and you know, they say,

37
00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:42.080
"Well, okay, we can work within this

38
00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.020
organizational structure".

39
00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.020
And, so what they do, is they create a bunch of sort of

40
00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.080
Agile-like processes, which try to push down some innovation

41
00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.050
in feedback to the team.

42
00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:57.020
So, essentially, you take away a lot of their flexibility

43
00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.040
so you can assign work to teams, sometimes they're

44
00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.000
you know, Safe uses something called Agile Release Trains,

45
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.060
or ARTs, which are like product streams,

46
00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.050
and then you put, sort of, work into those.

47
00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.020
But, of course, the challenge with that is that it

48
00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.000
takes away from a lot of the creativity of the teams.

49
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.070
You know, typically, you know scrum teams, they have

50
00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:20.020
the ultimate flexibility to sort of deliver the product

51
00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:21.040
the way that they like.

52
00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.050
So, if you're working on a really big product,

53
00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.040
you have to take some of that away.

54
00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.010
But, the way that a lot of these scaled frameworks do it,

55
00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.070
is they take away, but then they kind of break them

56
00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:31.090
into phases.

57
00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:32.070
So it's almost like,

58
00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:33.060
"Okay, you're an Agile team, so you work on"

59
00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.080
- Oh, I'm getting a bit of a Waterfall feeling now.

60
00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.090
- Yeah, so you're like the wheel team,

61
00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.020
or you're the chassie team, and you're the paint team

62
00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:45.000
and you can be as agile as you want, making the wheel.

63
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.090
But, that's-

64
00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.050
- [Chris] But it's got to be ready by a certain date.

65
00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:51.000
- Right. And, so, it's kind of a little bit of a mish-mash.
