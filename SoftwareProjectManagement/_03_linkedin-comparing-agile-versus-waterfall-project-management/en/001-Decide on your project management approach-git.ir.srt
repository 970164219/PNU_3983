00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:05.060
- Welcome to this course

2
00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:09.050
where we're going to explore Agile versus Waterfall.

3
00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:12.060
And I'm personally going to be fascinated to record this.

4
00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:14.010
We're going to record it live.

5
00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:16.020
I'm going to interview Doug Rose.

6
00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.080
He's an expert on Agile and I'm really pleased I've got him

7
00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.090
because not only is he very knowledgeable

8
00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:23.000
he's made a whole load of courses on Agile

9
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.070
but also, he's really intelligent.

10
00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:28.040
And I have found that some people who like Agile

11
00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.080
I guess like anything else

12
00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.000
are just regurgitating stuff they've learned.

13
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.060
But what's great about Doug is he really understands it.

14
00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:36.060
The other thing I like about him

15
00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:37.080
is he's got a sense of humor.

16
00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.070
So I'm going to tease him a bit, he's going to tease me.

17
00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.020
And hopefully between us

18
00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.000
we're going to really get to the bottom

19
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.010
of the pros and cons of Agile.

20
00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.090
I don't even know what answer he's going to give.

21
00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.030
He's much more of an expert on Agile than I am.

22
00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.030
But I've got a load of questions.

23
00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.040
A load of things that worry me about Agile.

24
00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.010
So I'm going to ask him about 25 things

25
00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:01.070
and during that time we will get to the bottom of Agile.

26
00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.000
So, let's get started.
