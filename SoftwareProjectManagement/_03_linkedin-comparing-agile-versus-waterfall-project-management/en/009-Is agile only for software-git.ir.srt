1
00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.030
- And another thing I've got on my list actually

2
00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:11.000
is this idea of the minimal viable product here,

3
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.080
minimum viable product, MVP.

4
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.030
And this idea of, let's just make,

5
00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:18.050
sticking with my app example,

6
00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.070
let's just make the basic app that works,

7
00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.040
get it out there, 'cause then we can learn

8
00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.080
from the customers, and then we can make

9
00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.010
version two, and version three, and we'll

10
00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.060
gradually improve it.

11
00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.040
And that seems to me, related in a way,

12
00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.020
to what you're saying about you've at least

13
00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.000
got one room wired up, and you could at least

14
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.040
be using that or selling it, renting it out, or whatever.

15
00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.080
And I can see that, but it seems to me

16
00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:43.040
that quite a lot of things don't have

17
00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.040
a subsection that is viable.

18
00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.070
So if you're building a car, you wouldn't say,

19
00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.040
"Well the minimum viable car will just

20
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.070
"have the seat and the steering wheel, or whatever."

21
00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.010
You have to finish the whole thing

22
00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.020
before it's any use.

23
00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:00.010
And so I'm thinking that maybe Agile only works

24
00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.060
for things which you can add onto later.

25
00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:05.040
So our house example is kind of so ridiculous,

26
00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.090
'cause you've got the suspended kitchen,

27
00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.080
but do you think it's true that in the end

28
00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.050
Agile only really works on software?

29
00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:16.000
Is there anything other than software

30
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.040
that you could use it for?

31
00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.040
- Yeah, it works for, I actually work more now

32
00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.060
with it using data products.

33
00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.080
If you have five petabyte data set,

34
00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.040
you can use Agile to gain insights from that.

35
00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.060
But it is much better suited,

36
00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.000
there are people who use Agile for HR products

37
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.050
and things like that, but it is much better suited

38
00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:42.060
for digital products, something that can be easily reworked.

39
00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.000
- 'Cause there is a trend, I've noticed just looking

40
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.060
on YouTube and the occasional article you read

41
00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.050
on LinkedIn and things, that people are trying

42
00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:50.030
to push it out into other areas,

43
00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.080
and could we, if we were going to rewire a building,

44
00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.090
could it be done as a series of sprints?

45
00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.030
I think they are trying to push it out into other areas,

46
00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.020
probably because consultants get paid money

47
00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.090
for pushing this, but do you think there is any mileage

48
00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.070
for pushing it out into other areas?

49
00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:11.010
Or do you think they're just trying to get paid more

50
00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:12.090
for pushing their idea out wider?

51
00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.020
- Well, let's think about your car.

52
00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.000
So let's say that we just start, if Elon Musk can do it,

53
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.030
let's say you and I do it, Chris and Doug's Automotive.

54
00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.040
And so we start building an agile car.

55
00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.080
So what would we deliver in the very first sprint

56
00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.060
of that car?

57
00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.000
What do you think?

58
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.070
- Well before I answer that, I want to tell you

59
00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:39.070
about a poster I saw at one of my customer's offices,

60
00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:40.080
'cause they were Agile.

61
00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.040
And they had this poster, and it said,

62
00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:48.040
Agile and Waterfall, and Waterfall was just a wheel,

63
00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.070
and then just a steering wheel, and then just the shell,

64
00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:54.000
and then the finished car.

65
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.060
And they were somehow saying that

66
00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.060
that was never going to suddenly happen,

67
00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.070
it wasn't going to suddenly evolve like that.

68
00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:02.090
And then Agile had a skate board,

69
00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.020
and then it had a push bike, and then it had a motorbike,

70
00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:07.070
and then it had a car I think.

71
00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:09.090
And the idea was that you would sort of evolve.

72
00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.030
And I was looking at this, and I was thinking, No!

73
00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.000
Because if you were going to build a car,

74
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.080
you would build the chassis, and the steering wheel,

75
00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.020
and you wouldn't, if you were going to build a car,

76
00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:21.080
your first sprint wouldn't be to make a skate board

77
00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:24.030
and then throw that away and make a bicycle.

78
00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.090
So although those things have evolved,

79
00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:30.010
and you could say evolution is kind of Agile,

80
00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:31.090
that's not how you would do it.

81
00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.040
'Cause if we were going to make a car,

82
00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.000
we wouldn't make a skate board first.

83
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.090
So the answer is, I can't imagine

84
00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.070
what the first sprint would be.

85
00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:44.030
I think we probably would have to make a whole car,

86
00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:45.060
and then see what it was like,

87
00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:46.090
and then make the car better.

88
00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:49.050
- Yeah, no you're exactly right.

89
00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:54.010
We wouldn't use, if we were going to deliver a car

90
00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:57.000
as a project, you're absolutely right.

91
00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.040
It's chassis, whatever you'd go through,

92
00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.010
and then at the very end it would be like

93
00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:03.030
the Detroit Auto Show, we would pull back the sheet,

94
00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:04.040
and there would be the car.

95
00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.000
- [Chris] And Waterfall could deliver that.

96
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.050
- Waterfall, yeah, because assuming that you have

97
00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:10.080
all of the planning, and you have the design specs,

98
00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.000
Detroit's been doing this for decades.

99
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.010
But if you were going to use an Agile approach,

100
00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:20.010
then you're focused on the value.

101
00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:22.030
So if you're focused on the value,

102
00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:25.000
then you and I would meet with the customer

103
00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.090
and we would say, "What's valuable about a car?"

104
00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:32.080
And they would say, "This is transportation,"

105
00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.090
that's the valuable thing in a car is transportation.

106
00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:40.070
And so we're here in London, and so it might be very easy,

107
00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:42.000
if you and I were just focused

108
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.070
on the transportation business, not on the car business,

109
00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:47.010
but on the transportation business,

110
00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:49.080
so we're not focused on delivering a car project,

111
00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.080
we're focused on delivering valuable items,

112
00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.020
valuable products in the transportation business,

113
00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:58.040
then something here in London that might

114
00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:01.010
be really valuable is a motor bike.

115
00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:04.050
Because if you only have to go a half a mile away,

116
00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:07.030
or a kilometers, I'm not great with the metric system yet,

117
00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:11.000
but if you only have to go a few kilometers away,

118
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.090
then I wouldn't want a car if I were living here,

119
00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:15.060
I'd want a motorcycle, or even a bicycle

120
00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:18.000
or something like that.

121
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.030
So if we were doing an Agile product,

122
00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:22.000
we would build it up over time,

123
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.070
and then we'd let the customer test it out

124
00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:25.060
through the streets of London, see what works

125
00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:29.000
best for them in terms of adding value

126
00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.080
to their transportation need.

127
00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:33.090
- But I think I would say that with Waterfall,

128
00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:35.070
if a customer said, "I want a car,"

129
00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:37.060
you'd say, "Okay, let's define it,"

130
00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:40.020
and the first stage of Waterfall is to define

131
00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:41.090
what the project is going to be.

132
00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:43.040
What are you going to deliver?

133
00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:45.030
And you would spend quite a lot of time,

134
00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:48.030
perhaps more time than you do with Agile,

135
00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:49.090
thinking about what are you going to have?

136
00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:51.020
And with something like a website,

137
00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:52.060
if you're doing it traditionally,

138
00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:54.090
you really force the customer to think carefully

139
00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:56.020
about what do you want?

140
00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:58.000
Whereas with Agile, don't you just wade in and say,

141
00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.010
"Well let's start making it, 'cause you can

142
00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:01.000
"always worry about the detail later."

143
00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.020
So I would argue that that defining of what

144
00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:08.020
the product is, is just as strong with Waterfall, isn't it?

145
00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:11.040
- Well in Waterfall what you're doing

146
00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:12.090
is you're trying to have your customer

147
00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:15.030
commit to requirements.

148
00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:17.060
And so, you're saying, "This is what you want,

149
00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:20.060
"and this is what we're going to deliver."

150
00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:23.010
When you're working with Scrum, trying to build

151
00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:25.060
out a product using Scrum or something like that,

152
00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:29.030
then you're not talking about what the product is,

153
00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:31.080
you're talking about what they want.

154
00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:34.000
And then you build it up a little bit at a time.

155
00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
So let's take a website or something,

156
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.010
but you're right, if you have the requirements,

157
00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:40.030
exactly what that website's going to do,

158
00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:41.070
then that's great.

159
00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:45.090
But if you wanted to try a Scrum using an Agile mindset,

160
00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:49.060
you could build out one page of that website,

161
00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:52.030
let the customer give you feedback about it,

162
00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:54.050
and then work on, build out different pieces

163
00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:56.000
of it over time.
