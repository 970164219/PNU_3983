1
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.030
- But if I know that all the rooms that I want,

2
00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:09.060
I'm pretty definite about what I want in my house.

3
00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:11.000
I know I want three bedrooms

4
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
as well as the kitchen, bathroom and stuff.

5
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.040
As an Agile person, can you tell me

6
00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:20.030
what that's going to cost and when it's going to be ready?

7
00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:25.060
- Well, I mean what I could do is I could tell you roughly

8
00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.050
how much construction will take place

9
00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.090
based on the number of people working

10
00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.030
and the number of sprints that we'd estimate

11
00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.080
if you're using Scrum.

12
00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.010
And so, I could tell you, you know,

13
00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:38.040
here's what we're going to make.

14
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.050
But seeing an Agile product,

15
00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.080
you could be six sprints in

16
00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.010
and you could say, you know what?

17
00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.040
I don't want three bedrooms, I want two kitchens.

18
00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:48.030
- Yeah.

19
00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.030
- It's possible, and so--

20
00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.010
- Well with my app I did change my mind quite a lot

21
00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:52.000
as I went through. - Yeah.

22
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.080
- But clearly with a house you wouldn't change your mind,

23
00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:54.070
but with an app. - But you might,

24
00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:56.070
I mean if it's software product it's very common

25
00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.010
and so you could, if your customer decides

26
00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:01.090
they want to, and maybe do something maybe then instead

27
00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:04.000
of second bedroom, they want an office.

28
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.060
Or they want a room with a fire place or something.

29
00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.020
So if you're working at a team with an Agile mindset

30
00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.070
and the customer has that flexibility,

31
00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.070
then because your giving them that flexibility,

32
00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.020
you can't tell them exactly what's going to be delivered

33
00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.080
at the end because they could change their mind.

34
00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:26.080
And so, this kind of iterative and incremental delivery

35
00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.080
is kind of the key to the predictability.

36
00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.050
- So if I'm a customer who really is definitely not

37
00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:34.000
going to change my mind, there'd be not point

38
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.070
in using Agile because I'd be wasting

39
00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.030
the one really great feature that it has, kind of thing.

40
00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.050
Having said that, does that type of customer ever exist?

41
00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:43.060
'Cause they always change their--

42
00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.090
So something you said just then that I hadn't thought about.

43
00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.050
Well I have thought about, but I hadn't thought about it

44
00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:52.070
with Agile, is in normal project management,

45
00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.020
conventional project management,

46
00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.040
there are two types of times, hours worked

47
00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.050
and there's elapsed time.

48
00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:02.030
Which, I prefer to use weeks for that

49
00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.030
and what I teach on my training courses is,

50
00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.070
you shouldn't really talk in days, 'cause if you say,

51
00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:12.010
this job is three days work, does that mean it's three days

52
00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:16.090
of cost, if you like, one person working for three days?

53
00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.020
Or is it three days of elapsed time?

54
00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.090
Whereas if you talk about hours and weeks,

55
00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.080
then you know that a ten hour job might take you three weeks

56
00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.060
because of other work and interruptions

57
00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:27.050
and things like that.

58
00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:30.050
So the game in ordinary project management

59
00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:34.050
is to estimate how many hours of work are in something

60
00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:39.030
and also how many weeks of elapsed time it's going to take.

61
00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.020
And, I'm realizing, listening to you,

62
00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:43.040
I don't know whether this is right,

63
00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.060
that if you've got developers working on stuff,

64
00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.090
if you know that a sprint is a week,

65
00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.000
- Two typical. - Two weeks.

66
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.040
Then that two weeks is solid work,

67
00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.020
so that's both hours used and duration.

68
00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:02.040
Or do you distinguish between hours worked and duration?

69
00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.080
Or are they kind of the same because they're full time

70
00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.000
on one project?

71
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.080
- Right.

72
00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.030
And so, typically if you're in an Agile team working with,

73
00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.010
using sort of a Scrum framework,

74
00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:14.040
then people will be timeboxed.

75
00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.030
Because in a typical project you might crash it,

76
00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.010
you know, might broke more people into it at the end.

77
00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:22.040
You might pad the hours

78
00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.040
to try and give yourself some flexibility.

79
00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.040
But there's no room for that in Scrum,

80
00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.050
because it's only two weeks.

81
00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:33.010
And so, every developed should be timeboxed to eight hours,

82
00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:37.000
that's their workday, and they should be able to focus

83
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.050
on having a predictable amount of work

84
00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:42.080
come out of the team every spring.

85
00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.050
And so, when I said that I thought that Waterfall

86
00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:48.010
was too flexible, this is what I meant,

87
00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:51.020
is that Scrum is extremely rigid.

88
00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:53.010
- So what about if there's creativity in there

89
00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.040
and we don't know how long it will take to solve a problem

90
00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.040
or design something that's good enough for it?

91
00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.060
How do they cope with that?

92
00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.010
Not that Waterfall copes very well with that either,

93
00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:05.000
so that's not going to work is it, 'cause they won't be able

94
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.080
to finish that sprint in the two weeks?

95
00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.000
- Well Scrum always says that if you want to have

96
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
sort of creativity or something like that,

97
00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.090
then the best thing to do is think smaller.

98
00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:17.080
And so, if you are working on very specific, you know,

99
00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:19.080
a lot of times typically they'll use user stories

100
00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:20.090
or something like that.

101
00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:23.090
If you're working at a very small chunk of work,

102
00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:28.020
then you have a lot more flexibility to be creative,

103
00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:30.060
then if you're working on something enormous.

104
00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:34.050
And so there is creativity within that two week sprint

105
00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:37.050
but at the end of the day, you're going to be showing

106
00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:39.090
that product to your customer at the end of that sprint.

107
00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:43.070
And so you can't sort of have your creativity,

108
00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:46.030
have your delivery come at the expense of your creativity.

109
00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:48.000
- So you can't just play as long as you like?

110
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.050
'Cause there is a showdown with a customer

111
00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:51.070
every two weeks where you have to show something to them.

112
00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:52.060
- Right.

113
00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:54.010
I mean you could and maybe you could explain it

114
00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:56.050
to your customer and just be like, well look, you know,

115
00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:58.060
we've came up with a much more creative way to do this

116
00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:00.080
and that's why your not really seeing the product this week,

117
00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.010
you know, at the end of the spring.

118
00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:05.020
But the customer has to understand that in real time.

119
00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:09.000
So you can't just, you know, and a lot of times in projects

120
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.050
you'll have these things called handoffs.

121
00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:12.090
You know, in typical Waterfall projects,

122
00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:15.010
where people will be waiting for someone to complete

123
00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:17.010
some work before they start.

124
00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:20.020
And so they'll that time to do research

125
00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:22.050
or come up with some sort of creative ways to do it.

126
00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:25.010
But the problem is is that you're still getting your work

127
00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:27.040
later and so you don't know if all that research

128
00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:29.030
and creativity is going to have any impact

129
00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:31.050
because you don't actually receive your work yet.

130
00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:32.090
But in Agile, since you're working in Scrum,

131
00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:35.030
since you're working every weeks,

132
00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:37.040
you're constantly interacting with your work

133
00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:38.080
and coming up with creative solutions

134
00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:39.070
at the same time.

135
00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:42.000
And you have your head down working on it.
