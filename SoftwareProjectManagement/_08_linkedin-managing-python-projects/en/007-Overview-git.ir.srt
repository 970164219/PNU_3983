00:00:00,05 --> 00:00:03,01
- [Instructor] Unlike Java, where there's a very specific

2
00:00:03,01 --> 00:00:05,03
directory structure you should follow,

3
00:00:05,03 --> 00:00:08,07
Python does not force you to a directory structure.

4
00:00:08,07 --> 00:00:10,07
You could have a single .py file

5
00:00:10,07 --> 00:00:12,07
or some directory structure.

6
00:00:12,07 --> 00:00:15,01
As long as Python can input your model,

7
00:00:15,01 --> 00:00:16,08
you should be okay.

8
00:00:16,08 --> 00:00:19,05
What we have however, are some best practices

9
00:00:19,05 --> 00:00:22,01
on how to structure your project.

10
00:00:22,01 --> 00:00:25,05
Our project is an early version of an NLP,

11
00:00:25,05 --> 00:00:28,01
natural language processing, package.

12
00:00:28,01 --> 00:00:31,03
We're going to use the same directory, nlpy,

13
00:00:31,03 --> 00:00:33,03
in the following videos.

14
00:00:33,03 --> 00:00:36,04
Here's how the code looks like when you first get it

15
00:00:36,04 --> 00:00:39,07
from source control, say doing a Git clone.

16
00:00:39,07 --> 00:00:42,00
You have a mix of the actual Python code

17
00:00:42,00 --> 00:00:43,03
in the nlp directory,

18
00:00:43,03 --> 00:00:47,04
in the dot there init, htpd, stop_words.py.

19
00:00:47,04 --> 00:00:50,09
We have some tests in the test directory

20
00:00:50,09 --> 00:00:52,04
and then some other files,

21
00:00:52,04 --> 00:00:55,07
license, makefile for automation, readme,

22
00:00:55,07 --> 00:00:57,04
which you can see on the right,

23
00:00:57,04 --> 00:01:00,04
the requirements file, and a setup.py.

24
00:01:00,04 --> 00:01:03,07
This structure has served me well for over 20 years

25
00:01:03,07 --> 00:01:05,07
and according to the Lindy effect,

26
00:01:05,07 --> 00:01:08,02
it will probably serve me many more.

27
00:01:08,02 --> 00:01:10,08
The nice thing about a familiar directory structure

28
00:01:10,08 --> 00:01:14,03
is that you don't have to think or search much.

29
00:01:14,03 --> 00:01:15,05
You know where the sources are,

30
00:01:15,05 --> 00:01:19,00
where the tests are, and how to run some tasks.
