00:00:00,05 --> 00:00:02,02
- [Instructor] There are many ways to work together

2
00:00:02,02 --> 00:00:04,01
on the same code base.

3
00:00:04,01 --> 00:00:08,02
One of the common ones is to use feature branches.

4
00:00:08,02 --> 00:00:10,03
A branch is a part of development path

5
00:00:10,03 --> 00:00:11,09
on the same code base.

6
00:00:11,09 --> 00:00:14,05
A feature branch is a part development path

7
00:00:14,05 --> 00:00:18,08
that is dedicated to a specific feature or an issue.

8
00:00:18,08 --> 00:00:20,07
Once you start work on an issue,

9
00:00:20,07 --> 00:00:22,05
create a feature branch for it

10
00:00:22,05 --> 00:00:24,08
and work on this branch.

11
00:00:24,08 --> 00:00:26,09
A nice convention is to call the branch

12
00:00:26,09 --> 00:00:29,03
with the name of the feature.

13
00:00:29,03 --> 00:00:33,00
We have our issue to document the tokenize function.

14
00:00:33,00 --> 00:00:36,06
So we'll do git checkout -b,

15
00:00:36,06 --> 00:00:38,04
meaning create a new branch,

16
00:00:38,04 --> 00:00:43,06
and then call it issue/1-document-tokenize.

17
00:00:43,06 --> 00:00:47,02
And now we're working in the document tokenize branch.

18
00:00:47,02 --> 00:00:50,06
Now we can go to our code,

19
00:00:50,06 --> 00:00:52,01
and add a commentation string

20
00:00:52,01 --> 00:00:54,07
to the tokenize function.

21
00:00:54,07 --> 00:00:56,04
Once we save our code,

22
00:00:56,04 --> 00:00:59,03
we're ready to go.

23
00:00:59,03 --> 00:01:00,08
We can do git status

24
00:01:00,08 --> 00:01:02,01
to see what has changed.

25
00:01:02,01 --> 00:01:05,00
And we see that we have one modified files.

26
00:01:05,00 --> 00:01:10,07
Then do git add nlp/_init_.py.

27
00:01:10,07 --> 00:01:13,02
And then we do git commit,

28
00:01:13,02 --> 00:01:18,07
and we'll give it the message document tokenize.

29
00:01:18,07 --> 00:01:22,03
Now the branch is still local to our developer machine.

30
00:01:22,03 --> 00:01:24,09
We need to push it to the server.

31
00:01:24,09 --> 00:01:29,00
So we do git push -u, meaning track.

32
00:01:29,00 --> 00:01:34,01
And then origin, which is where the repository came from.

33
00:01:34,01 --> 00:01:36,00
And the name of the branch,

34
00:01:36,00 --> 00:01:41,05
which is issue/1-document-tokenize.

35
00:01:41,05 --> 00:01:47,04
And now this branch is being sent to github.

36
00:01:47,04 --> 00:01:49,05
If you go to the code now,

37
00:01:49,05 --> 00:01:53,08
we can see now that we have a new document tokenize branch.

38
00:01:53,08 --> 00:01:55,06
The main branch might get updates

39
00:01:55,06 --> 00:01:58,03
before you merge your feature branch into it.

40
00:01:58,03 --> 00:02:01,01
Make sure to merge early and often.

41
00:02:01,01 --> 00:02:03,00
And once the branch is approved,

42
00:02:03,00 --> 00:02:04,06
you should be in a code review.

43
00:02:04,06 --> 00:02:08,00
Merge and squash it to the main development branch.
