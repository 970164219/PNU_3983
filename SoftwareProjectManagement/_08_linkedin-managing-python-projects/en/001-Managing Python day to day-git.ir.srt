"when you add time and other programmers."

00:00:08,03 --> 00:00:11,06
As software developers, we rarely work alone.

00:00:11,06 --> 00:00:14,05
This means that apart from writing code,

00:00:14,05 --> 00:00:18,04
we spend our days coordinating with other developers.

Hi, I'm Miki Tebeka and I'm going to share with you

8
00:00:21,07 --> 00:00:23,08
some recipes I've learned throughout more

00:00:23,08 --> 00:00:27,07
than 20 years of developing products with Python.

10
00:00:27,07 --> 00:00:30,04
Most of these methods are lightweight.

11
00:00:30,04 --> 00:00:32,08
They will help your team stay coordinated

12
00:00:32,08 --> 00:00:34,06
while allowing you to spend more time

13
00:00:34,06 --> 00:00:37,00
on what you love, writing Python.
