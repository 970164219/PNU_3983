00:00:00,00 --> 00:00:03,07
- [Instructor] A good process can help you avoid mistakes.

2
00:00:03,07 --> 00:00:06,03
By following a process we take steps that are meant

3
00:00:06,03 --> 00:00:07,08
to prevent errors.

4
00:00:07,08 --> 00:00:11,01
Some of these steps are automation.

5
00:00:11,01 --> 00:00:14,06
Automating tasks is a great way to avoid mistakes.

6
00:00:14,06 --> 00:00:17,01
Machines are less prone to make mistakes

7
00:00:17,01 --> 00:00:18,08
than us humans.

8
00:00:18,08 --> 00:00:20,00
Checklists.

9
00:00:20,00 --> 00:00:21,05
Checklists are great.

10
00:00:21,05 --> 00:00:23,07
Use them when you can't automate.

11
00:00:23,07 --> 00:00:25,09
Checklists embed best practices

12
00:00:25,09 --> 00:00:29,04
and eliminates error that comes from forgetting things.

13
00:00:29,04 --> 00:00:31,06
If you're skeptical about checklists

14
00:00:31,06 --> 00:00:34,01
you can read "The Checklist Manifesto"

15
00:00:34,01 --> 00:00:36,01
or search for checklists in our offerings

16
00:00:36,01 --> 00:00:38,07
and see how much it's mentioned.

17
00:00:38,07 --> 00:00:40,03
Knowledge transfer.

18
00:00:40,03 --> 00:00:43,01
A good process embeds knowledge acquired over time.

19
00:00:43,01 --> 00:00:47,07
For example, require a new test for every new piece of code

20
00:00:47,07 --> 00:00:51,00
because a mistake will heavily affect your process.

21
00:00:51,00 --> 00:00:53,00
If you're writing a small API server

22
00:00:53,00 --> 00:00:55,09
used internally by your team, the cost of error

23
00:00:55,09 --> 00:00:57,08
is not that big.

24
00:00:57,08 --> 00:01:01,02
However if you're writing software for the mouse rover

25
00:01:01,02 --> 00:01:04,00
a bug can mean billions of dollars going to waste.
