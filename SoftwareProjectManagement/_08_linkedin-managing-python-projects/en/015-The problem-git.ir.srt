00:00:00,05 --> 00:00:03,08
- [Narrator] One of Python's mottos is "batteries included".

2
00:00:03,08 --> 00:00:05,09
When you install Python, you get a rich

3
00:00:05,09 --> 00:00:08,07
standard library, with many packages.

4
00:00:08,07 --> 00:00:11,07
A lot of times, the standard library will be enough.

5
00:00:11,07 --> 00:00:14,09
However, sometimes we need a package that's not

6
00:00:14,09 --> 00:00:18,02
in the standard library, a third party package.

7
00:00:18,02 --> 00:00:22,01
The central location for third party packages is PyPI.

8
00:00:22,01 --> 00:00:25,09
At the time of recording, it hosts about 200,000 packages.

9
00:00:25,09 --> 00:00:27,06
That's a lot to choose from.

10
00:00:27,06 --> 00:00:31,00
That's one of the problems with third party packages.

11
00:00:31,00 --> 00:00:32,06
At first glance, it's super easy

12
00:00:32,06 --> 00:00:34,07
to use a third party package.

13
00:00:34,07 --> 00:00:38,03
You pip install your package and it's ready for you to use.

14
00:00:38,03 --> 00:00:41,00
Let's look at what can go wrong.

15
00:00:41,00 --> 00:00:45,09
If you search for PostgreSQL

16
00:00:45,09 --> 00:00:47,03
in PyPI,

17
00:00:47,03 --> 00:00:51,00
you will get more than 1600 results.

18
00:00:51,00 --> 00:00:54,00
You need to ask around, check the project health,

19
00:00:54,00 --> 00:00:56,09
and run some tests before selecting.

20
00:00:56,09 --> 00:01:01,01
By the way, the recommended package is called psycopg2.

21
00:01:01,01 --> 00:01:03,07
Some packages, don't install easily.

22
00:01:03,07 --> 00:01:06,00
You might need extra shared C libraries

23
00:01:06,00 --> 00:01:08,01
or header files to install them.

24
00:01:08,01 --> 00:01:10,06
As you can see here in the documentation.

25
00:01:10,06 --> 00:01:12,04
You will need to make sure the environment in

26
00:01:12,04 --> 00:01:15,04
production measures the one developers are using.

27
00:01:15,04 --> 00:01:18,08
Sometimes, new versions cause regressions.

28
00:01:18,08 --> 00:01:21,05
Some packages are malicious.

29
00:01:21,05 --> 00:01:24,05
A maintainer might decide to remove a package

30
00:01:24,05 --> 00:01:27,02
that you're depending on from PyPI.

31
00:01:27,02 --> 00:01:29,06
There might be even more issues.

32
00:01:29,06 --> 00:01:31,05
I recommended reading Russ Cox's

33
00:01:31,05 --> 00:01:34,00
'Our Software Dependency Problem.'

34
00:01:34,00 --> 00:01:35,06
Even though it's not on Python,

35
00:01:35,06 --> 00:01:38,01
it summarizes the problem well.

36
00:01:38,01 --> 00:01:40,09
And we're not saying stop using third party packages,

37
00:01:40,09 --> 00:01:42,08
they are very useful.

38
00:01:42,08 --> 00:01:45,00
You need to be aware of the cost and try to use

39
00:01:45,00 --> 00:01:48,00
the standard library as much as you can.
