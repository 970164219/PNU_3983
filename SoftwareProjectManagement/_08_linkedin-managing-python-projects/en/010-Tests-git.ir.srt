00:00:00,05 --> 00:00:04,08
- [Instructor] In 2010, GitHub suffered a severe outage.

2
00:00:04,08 --> 00:00:08,03
The cause was tests accidentally running in production,

3
00:00:08,03 --> 00:00:10,07
deleting the main database.

4
00:00:10,07 --> 00:00:13,03
Many companies learn this lesson the hard way.

5
00:00:13,03 --> 00:00:17,06
Do all you can to make sure tests don't run in production,

6
00:00:17,06 --> 00:00:20,09
including placing them in a separate directory.

7
00:00:20,09 --> 00:00:24,09
In our case, this directory is called tests,

8
00:00:24,09 --> 00:00:30,02
because both test and testing are built-in models.

9
00:00:30,02 --> 00:00:33,03
We'll talk about testing in-depth in another episode,

10
00:00:33,03 --> 00:00:35,02
but you should have tests.

11
00:00:35,02 --> 00:00:37,07
Apart from yourself in it when making changes

12
00:00:37,07 --> 00:00:39,05
and validating your code,

13
00:00:39,05 --> 00:00:42,00
they also send a signal to potential users

14
00:00:42,00 --> 00:00:44,07
that you're serious about your code.

15
00:00:44,07 --> 00:00:47,00
Tests can also serve as the commentation.

16
00:00:47,00 --> 00:00:49,02
By reading test code, people will be able

17
00:00:49,02 --> 00:00:51,09
to understand how to use your package.

18
00:00:51,09 --> 00:00:55,04
The tests directory mostly contains Python files,

19
00:00:55,04 --> 00:00:58,00
but it can also contain some auxiliary data.
