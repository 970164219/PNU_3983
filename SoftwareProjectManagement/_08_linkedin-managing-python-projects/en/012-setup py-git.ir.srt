00:00:00,05 --> 00:00:02,06
- [Instructor] Setup.py is Python's way

2
00:00:02,06 --> 00:00:04,04
of defining a project.

3
00:00:04,04 --> 00:00:06,06
We import setup from functools

4
00:00:06,06 --> 00:00:11,04
and then we read the description from the readme file,

5
00:00:11,04 --> 00:00:15,04
and we load the requirements from the files.

6
00:00:15,04 --> 00:00:18,06
Requirements-dev and regular requirements.

7
00:00:18,06 --> 00:00:20,05
And we also have a utility function

8
00:00:20,05 --> 00:00:25,02
to read the version from _init_.py.

9
00:00:25,02 --> 00:00:28,04
The final step is calling the setup function.

10
00:00:28,04 --> 00:00:31,00
We say the project name is nlp,

11
00:00:31,00 --> 00:00:33,04
the version we read from the _init_,

12
00:00:33,04 --> 00:00:36,03
the package is nlpy.

13
00:00:36,03 --> 00:00:39,08
Entry points which will create a script called nlpd,

14
00:00:39,08 --> 00:00:42,02
then what is required for installation

15
00:00:42,02 --> 00:00:44,04
and what is required for tests.

16
00:00:44,04 --> 00:00:47,01
We have description, a long description,

17
00:00:47,01 --> 00:00:49,01
what is the license for the package,

18
00:00:49,01 --> 00:00:52,00
and then some information about the project.
