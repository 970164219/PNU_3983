00:00:00,01 --> 00:00:06,00
(upbeat techno music)

2
00:00:06,00 --> 00:00:08,08
- [Instructor] Here's my solution to the challenge.

3
00:00:08,08 --> 00:00:11,00
I've created a slowmath directory,

4
00:00:11,00 --> 00:00:13,07
and copied code to down right beneath there.

5
00:00:13,07 --> 00:00:16,09
I added the doc string and a version.

6
00:00:16,09 --> 00:00:20,07
Then I added an empty test, a license file,

7
00:00:20,07 --> 00:00:24,00
a Makefile for automation, a README,

8
00:00:24,00 --> 00:00:26,02
development requirements, since you don't have

9
00:00:26,02 --> 00:00:29,08
any requirements for production, and a setup.py.

10
00:00:29,08 --> 00:00:33,03
And, as you can see, now I can run make test

11
00:00:33,03 --> 00:00:35,00
and the test will run.
