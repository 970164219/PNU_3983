00:00:00,05 --> 00:00:02,00
A python interpreter can work with

2
00:00:02,00 --> 00:00:05,00
only one version of a package at a time.

3
00:00:05,00 --> 00:00:09,03
If you work on two projects, one using pandas 0.22,

4
00:00:09,03 --> 00:00:12,05
and the other using pandas 0.25, this can

5
00:00:12,05 --> 00:00:13,07
be an issue.

6
00:00:13,07 --> 00:00:16,08
A lot of unit distributions, and also OSX,

7
00:00:16,08 --> 00:00:19,07
uses Python scripts to manage the system,

8
00:00:19,07 --> 00:00:22,02
which means that if you install a non-compatible

9
00:00:22,02 --> 00:00:23,05
version of a package,

10
00:00:23,05 --> 00:00:25,06
you broke the system.

11
00:00:25,06 --> 00:00:29,02
To solve these problems, we use virtual environments.

12
00:00:29,02 --> 00:00:31,06
A virtual environment is an isolated Python

13
00:00:31,06 --> 00:00:33,01
installation.

14
00:00:33,01 --> 00:00:35,03
You create a virtual environment for a project

15
00:00:35,03 --> 00:00:36,01
that you work on.

16
00:00:36,01 --> 00:00:39,04
To create a virtual environment, you can use the

17
00:00:39,04 --> 00:00:41,01
built-in venv model,

18
00:00:41,01 --> 00:00:44,03
or the popular third party virtualenv.

19
00:00:44,03 --> 00:00:46,03
I'm going to use the latter.

20
00:00:46,03 --> 00:00:48,00
Note that if you use other package

21
00:00:48,00 --> 00:00:50,00
managers, the following commands

22
00:00:50,00 --> 00:00:51,01
might differ.

23
00:00:51,01 --> 00:00:53,08
Read the documentation.

24
00:00:53,08 --> 00:00:58,05
So, virtualenv venv will create a

25
00:00:58,05 --> 00:01:01,00
directory called venv with an isolated

26
00:01:01,00 --> 00:01:04,05
installation of Python.

27
00:01:04,05 --> 00:01:07,03
Now, once I have the virtual environmenent,

28
00:01:07,03 --> 00:01:09,07
I can install my dependencies.

29
00:01:09,07 --> 00:01:14,01
/venv/bin/python -m pip install- r,

30
00:01:14,01 --> 00:01:19,09
and then the requirements I have,

31
00:01:19,09 --> 00:01:21,05
and these are going to get installed

32
00:01:21,05 --> 00:01:23,07
into the virtual environment,

33
00:01:23,07 --> 00:01:26,05
not into the system Python.

34
00:01:26,05 --> 00:01:27,09
You need to use Python from a

35
00:01:27,09 --> 00:01:30,08
virtual environment in your project.

36
00:01:30,08 --> 00:01:32,09
Most Python IDs ,such as Pycharm,

37
00:01:32,09 --> 00:01:36,03
know about virtual environments and how to use them.

38
00:01:36,03 --> 00:01:38,00
Read the documentation.
