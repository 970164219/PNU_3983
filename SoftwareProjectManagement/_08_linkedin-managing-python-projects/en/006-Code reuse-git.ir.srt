00:00:00,05 --> 00:00:02,07
- [Instructor] By writing code in an established way,

2
00:00:02,07 --> 00:00:06,00
we can pack and reuse this code in other projects.

3
00:00:06,00 --> 00:00:08,06
This is a huge gain since it gives us a system

4
00:00:08,06 --> 00:00:11,05
where one bot fix or a new feature can be used

5
00:00:11,05 --> 00:00:14,05
by all of the clients of this package.

6
00:00:14,05 --> 00:00:16,07
In the Python ward, we have an established way

7
00:00:16,07 --> 00:00:18,08
of packaging code.

8
00:00:18,08 --> 00:00:20,05
When you package code in a way

9
00:00:20,05 --> 00:00:23,02
that a package manager, such as Peep, understands,

10
00:00:23,02 --> 00:00:26,00
people can easily use your code.

11
00:00:26,00 --> 00:00:29,07
Packaging is not just for open source project.

12
00:00:29,07 --> 00:00:32,05
Many companies have internal depositories of packages

13
00:00:32,05 --> 00:00:36,06
they use for infrastructure and other common tasks.

14
00:00:36,06 --> 00:00:38,03
They will use the same method for packaging

15
00:00:38,03 --> 00:00:40,06
and standard structure of code

16
00:00:40,06 --> 00:00:43,07
that many other Python projects use.

17
00:00:43,07 --> 00:00:45,09
It's easy for new employees to come in

18
00:00:45,09 --> 00:00:48,00
and get familiar with the code.
