1
00:00:00,00 --> 00:00:06,00
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:06,00 --> 00:00:07,05
- [Instructor] Here's my solution.

3
00:00:07,05 --> 00:00:11,09
The requirements.txt contains the production requirements,

4
00:00:11,09 --> 00:00:15,03
and the requirements are sorted alphabetically.

5
00:00:15,03 --> 00:00:18,05
The dev-requirements.txt contains

6
00:00:18,05 --> 00:00:20,06
the development requirements.

7
00:00:20,06 --> 00:00:24,05
And I have a makefile to create the virtual environment

8
00:00:24,05 --> 00:00:27,08
and the development virtual environment.

9
00:00:27,08 --> 00:00:31,01
And now I can run make dev-venv,

10
00:00:31,01 --> 00:00:34,06
which will create virtual environment for development,

11
00:00:34,06 --> 00:00:40,04
containing both production and development requirements.

12
00:00:40,04 --> 00:00:46,08
And here, I can run /venv/bin/python check_env,

13
00:00:46,08 --> 00:00:49,00
and it should exit cleanly.
