00:00:06,00 --> 00:00:08,03
- [Instructor] Create a virtual environment for a project

3
00:00:08,03 --> 00:00:11,05
that uses Flask dot version 1.1,

4
00:00:11,05 --> 00:00:15,02
Flask-Login version 0.4.1,

5
00:00:15,02 --> 00:00:18,02
and numpy version 1.16.4.

6
00:00:18,02 --> 00:00:20,05
And for development requirement,

7
00:00:20,05 --> 00:00:23,07
this project uses flake8 version 3.7,

8
00:00:23,07 --> 00:00:26,02
pytest version 5.1.1,

9
00:00:26,02 --> 00:00:30,05
and pytest-benchmark version 3.2.2.

10
00:00:30,05 --> 00:00:32,07
Write your dependencies in files

11
00:00:32,07 --> 00:00:34,00
and have an automatic way

12
00:00:34,00 --> 00:00:36,06
to create the virtual environments.

13
00:00:36,06 --> 00:00:37,08
To test your environment,

14
00:00:37,08 --> 00:00:40,04
run Python from the virtual environment

15
00:00:40,04 --> 00:00:45,00
on the check_env.py file in the exercise files.
