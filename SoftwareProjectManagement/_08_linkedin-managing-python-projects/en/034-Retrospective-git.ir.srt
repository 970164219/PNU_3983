00:00:00,00 --> 00:00:01,05
- [Instructor] A retrospective,

2
00:00:01,05 --> 00:00:04,09
sometimes called postmortem, is a meeting you do

3
00:00:04,09 --> 00:00:07,00
at the end of a period or a sprint

4
00:00:07,00 --> 00:00:09,06
to discuss how you can improve.

5
00:00:09,06 --> 00:00:12,02
Retrospectives are very effective.

6
00:00:12,02 --> 00:00:14,00
Sadly, people tend to skip them

7
00:00:14,00 --> 00:00:17,04
and they have a low priority in many teams.

8
00:00:17,04 --> 00:00:20,08
You should always allocate time for retrospectives.

9
00:00:20,08 --> 00:00:23,06
You can do retrospective in physical meeting

10
00:00:23,06 --> 00:00:26,03
or in asynchronous way in a chat room

11
00:00:26,03 --> 00:00:28,01
or a shared document.

12
00:00:28,01 --> 00:00:31,03
I highly recommend to document these retrospectives

13
00:00:31,03 --> 00:00:32,04
since they common knowledge

14
00:00:32,04 --> 00:00:35,04
and represent organizational memory.

15
00:00:35,04 --> 00:00:38,04
Retrospectives can get long and tedious.

16
00:00:38,04 --> 00:00:41,08
Here's a template for making them short and effective.

17
00:00:41,08 --> 00:00:44,03
Everyone writes or talks about three things

18
00:00:44,03 --> 00:00:46,07
that went well and we should keep

19
00:00:46,07 --> 00:00:48,05
and three things that didn't go well

20
00:00:48,05 --> 00:00:50,07
and how to improve them.

21
00:00:50,07 --> 00:00:53,02
During the meeting if there are things to do,

22
00:00:53,02 --> 00:00:54,05
known as action items,

23
00:00:54,05 --> 00:00:57,02
make sure to add them to your issue tracking

24
00:00:57,02 --> 00:00:59,00
and allocate time for them.
