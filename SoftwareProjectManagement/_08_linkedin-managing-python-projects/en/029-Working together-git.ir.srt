00:00:00,05 --> 00:00:02,02
- [Instructor] We work better as a team

2
00:00:02,02 --> 00:00:05,00
and a good team is more than the sum of its parts.

3
00:00:05,00 --> 00:00:08,06
What helps us work together is a process.

4
00:00:08,06 --> 00:00:12,00
I see the development process as a set of rules we follow

5
00:00:12,00 --> 00:00:14,01
when working together.

6
00:00:14,01 --> 00:00:16,00
These rules help us collaborate,

7
00:00:16,00 --> 00:00:17,09
save us from making mistakes,

8
00:00:17,09 --> 00:00:20,04
and help us see the work progress.

9
00:00:20,04 --> 00:00:22,09
There's no one true process.

10
00:00:22,09 --> 00:00:24,05
In consulting and working with

11
00:00:24,05 --> 00:00:27,00
many companies and many teams,

12
00:00:27,00 --> 00:00:28,08
each of them have their own process

13
00:00:28,08 --> 00:00:31,09
that was shaped and reshaped over time.

14
00:00:31,09 --> 00:00:34,05
The process should serve the team

15
00:00:34,05 --> 00:00:36,05
and it's not a static thing.

16
00:00:36,05 --> 00:00:39,02
You should tweak the process to your needs over time

17
00:00:39,02 --> 00:00:43,02
and when the environment, say the group size, changes.

18
00:00:43,02 --> 00:00:45,05
We're going to talk about several common practices,

19
00:00:45,05 --> 00:00:49,02
such as source control, issue tracking, feature branches,

20
00:00:49,02 --> 00:00:52,01
code review, and retrospective.

21
00:00:52,01 --> 00:00:53,06
You might have most steps,

22
00:00:53,06 --> 00:00:57,00
but I highly recommend to have at least these steps.
