00:00:00,00 --> 00:00:01,02
- [Instructor] The good thing

2
00:00:01,02 --> 00:00:03,06
is much more than just a bunch of people,

3
00:00:03,06 --> 00:00:06,03
but in order to work together, we need to have a system.

4
00:00:06,03 --> 00:00:08,02
Sometimes this system

5
00:00:08,02 --> 00:00:10,09
will come on the expense of individuals.

6
00:00:10,09 --> 00:00:13,05
If you want to get some ice cream, ideally,

7
00:00:13,05 --> 00:00:15,07
you'll park your car right in the middle of the road

8
00:00:15,07 --> 00:00:18,02
next to the store entrance, go in,

9
00:00:18,02 --> 00:00:21,07
cut to be the first in line, pay, and get back home.

10
00:00:21,07 --> 00:00:24,00
However, you don't do that.

11
00:00:24,00 --> 00:00:26,09
You find an empty parking spot and park there,

12
00:00:26,09 --> 00:00:29,01
and you get to the back of the line.

13
00:00:29,01 --> 00:00:33,04
You do that since this is how we can function as a society.

14
00:00:33,04 --> 00:00:35,08
The same goes for software development.

15
00:00:35,08 --> 00:00:37,00
We need some structure

16
00:00:37,00 --> 00:00:40,00
in order to effectively work together.

17
00:00:40,00 --> 00:00:42,00
I've consulted in many companies.

18
00:00:42,00 --> 00:00:44,02
Each have their own process, and sometimes,

19
00:00:44,02 --> 00:00:47,08
teams inside the company will have a different process.

20
00:00:47,08 --> 00:00:48,09
What works for Google

21
00:00:48,09 --> 00:00:51,08
is probably an overkill for a small startup.

22
00:00:51,08 --> 00:00:56,02
Jared Spool said, "Too much process is just like no process,

23
00:00:56,02 --> 00:00:58,01
"except slower."

24
00:00:58,01 --> 00:01:01,07
Remember that the process should serve your team.

25
00:01:01,07 --> 00:01:04,06
If you find that the process is holding your team back,

26
00:01:04,06 --> 00:01:05,08
change it.

27
00:01:05,08 --> 00:01:08,00
Nothing is set in stone.
