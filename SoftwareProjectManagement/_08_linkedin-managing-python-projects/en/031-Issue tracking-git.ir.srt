1
00:00:00,05 --> 00:00:03,02
- [Instructor] Every piece of work you do should be tracked.

2
00:00:03,02 --> 00:00:06,01
It can be a back fix, a feature to implement,

3
00:00:06,01 --> 00:00:07,08
or a maintenance task.

4
00:00:07,08 --> 00:00:09,09
The seven issue tracking systems,

5
00:00:09,09 --> 00:00:13,04
such as Jira, Trello, Asana, and more.

6
00:00:13,04 --> 00:00:16,01
GitHub has its own issue system, which is good enough,

7
00:00:16,01 --> 00:00:17,08
in my opinion.

8
00:00:17,08 --> 00:00:21,02
So if you to our project, we see we have an issues tab,

9
00:00:21,02 --> 00:00:23,06
and we can add issues here.

10
00:00:23,06 --> 00:00:27,05
A good issue has a good title and a good description.

11
00:00:27,05 --> 00:00:30,02
Imagine yourself in a couple of months

12
00:00:30,02 --> 00:00:33,00
getting back to an issue to implement it.

13
00:00:33,00 --> 00:00:36,05
Be kind to your future self or fellow developers

14
00:00:36,05 --> 00:00:39,04
and invest time in creating a good issue.

15
00:00:39,04 --> 00:00:41,08
Some themes have templates for an issue

16
00:00:41,08 --> 00:00:44,02
with item such as these.

17
00:00:44,02 --> 00:00:47,07
Here's the pandas theme new issue template.

18
00:00:47,07 --> 00:00:50,02
So when you create a new issue in pandas,

19
00:00:50,02 --> 00:00:55,01
you get a template and you need to put in the code,

20
00:00:55,01 --> 00:00:58,04
the problem description, expected output,

21
00:00:58,04 --> 00:01:01,07
output of the version, etc. etc.

22
00:01:01,07 --> 00:01:05,01
Think about the checklist for your issues.

23
00:01:05,01 --> 00:01:08,00
Looking at our code in _init_.py, we see

24
00:01:08,00 --> 00:01:12,03
that in _init_, the tokenize function is not documented.

25
00:01:12,03 --> 00:01:15,00
Let's create an issue for it.

26
00:01:15,00 --> 00:01:19,01
So, we go to nlpy, we create a new issue,

27
00:01:19,01 --> 00:01:24,02
we write "Document tokenize."

28
00:01:24,02 --> 00:01:26,05
And here we could write in markdown format

29
00:01:26,05 --> 00:01:28,09
the description of the issue.

30
00:01:28,09 --> 00:01:32,05
"The tokenize function

31
00:01:32,05 --> 00:01:37,05
"in nlp._init_.py,"

32
00:01:37,05 --> 00:01:39,06
which lets people know where it is,

33
00:01:39,06 --> 00:01:44,07
"is not documented.

34
00:01:44,07 --> 00:01:50,02
"Add a docstring to the function."

35
00:01:50,02 --> 00:01:51,05
I think this is clear enough.

36
00:01:51,05 --> 00:01:54,06
You can hit the Preview and see how it looks.

37
00:01:54,06 --> 00:02:00,05
And once you're satisfied, you can submit the new issue.

38
00:02:00,05 --> 00:02:02,02
Other things we can do with the issue,

39
00:02:02,02 --> 00:02:05,09
we can assign it, so I am going to assign it to myself.

40
00:02:05,09 --> 00:02:09,07
We can add labels to issues for easier searching,

41
00:02:09,07 --> 00:02:12,07
and we can add milestones to issues saying,

42
00:02:12,07 --> 00:02:17,00
"This issue belongs to release 1.0.6."
