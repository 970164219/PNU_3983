00:00:00,05 --> 00:00:01,05
- [Instructor] Test fixtures

2
00:00:01,05 --> 00:00:04,02
creates a null environment for testing.

3
00:00:04,02 --> 00:00:07,08
A server tests need a database with some data in it.

4
00:00:07,08 --> 00:00:10,06
You can use a fixture to create such as database

5
00:00:10,06 --> 00:00:13,02
and populate it before every test run

6
00:00:13,02 --> 00:00:15,09
or every test file run.

7
00:00:15,09 --> 00:00:17,01
As soon as you have a code

8
00:00:17,01 --> 00:00:19,04
to create a table in a database.

9
00:00:19,04 --> 00:00:21,04
We have db.py.

10
00:00:21,04 --> 00:00:24,02
We have the definition of the sql_schema.

11
00:00:24,02 --> 00:00:26,04
And in line 15, create_schema

12
00:00:26,04 --> 00:00:29,04
which will populate the database with the new schema,

13
00:00:29,04 --> 00:00:31,02
creating tables there.

14
00:00:31,02 --> 00:00:33,08
To have the database automatically created

15
00:00:33,08 --> 00:00:36,04
you can use a pytest fixture.

16
00:00:36,04 --> 00:00:41,09
You should use a file length conftest in the test directory.

17
00:00:41,09 --> 00:00:44,01
We input pytest

18
00:00:44,01 --> 00:00:47,00
and we input sqlite3 which is an impeded database

19
00:00:47,00 --> 00:00:48,09
that comes with the Python.

20
00:00:48,09 --> 00:00:52,05
In line six, we define a function called database.

21
00:00:52,05 --> 00:00:56,09
And in line five we decorate it with pytest.fixture.

22
00:00:56,09 --> 00:00:59,04
In line seven we create the connection.

23
00:00:59,04 --> 00:01:02,03
In line eight we yield the connection.

24
00:01:02,03 --> 00:01:03,09
Pytest will lose this connection.

25
00:01:03,09 --> 00:01:05,07
And once the test is done,

26
00:01:05,07 --> 00:01:08,09
it will continue the code from line nine and 10

27
00:01:08,09 --> 00:01:10,08
to do some clean up.

28
00:01:10,08 --> 00:01:13,06
To use this fixture in the test,

29
00:01:13,06 --> 00:01:17,01
we define in line four def test_create_schema,

30
00:01:17,01 --> 00:01:19,06
which gets a parameter called database.

31
00:01:19,06 --> 00:01:20,08
This parameter name

32
00:01:20,08 --> 00:01:25,08
must match the name of the fixture file in conftest.py.

33
00:01:25,08 --> 00:01:27,08
And then we create the schema,

34
00:01:27,08 --> 00:01:29,07
we do our checks,

35
00:01:29,07 --> 00:01:32,01
and at the end when the test will be done,

36
00:01:32,01 --> 00:01:35,06
pytest will call the clean up code for us.

37
00:01:35,06 --> 00:01:42,06
And now we can run python -m pytest -v tests.

38
00:01:42,06 --> 00:01:46,00
And we see that test_create_schema has passed.
