00:00:00,07 --> 00:00:06,00
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:06,00 --> 00:00:07,06
- [Instructor] Create an issue to add a function

3
00:00:07,06 --> 00:00:09,06
called sentencize that will take a text

4
00:00:09,06 --> 00:00:12,04
and split it to sentences.

5
00:00:12,04 --> 00:00:14,08
Once you create the issue, implement the code

6
00:00:14,08 --> 00:00:17,07
in a feature branch and create the pull request.

7
00:00:17,07 --> 00:00:19,09
Don't forget to write tests.

8
00:00:19,09 --> 00:00:22,08
Once the pull review is ready, have a friend review it,

9
00:00:22,08 --> 00:00:25,08
and once they approve, merge to master.

10
00:00:25,08 --> 00:00:28,07
In the exercise file, you can find my implementation

11
00:00:28,07 --> 00:00:32,00
to sentencize and the tests to run.
