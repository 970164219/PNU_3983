00:00:00,00 --> 00:00:02,01
- [Miki] In this course, I tried to show you

2
00:00:02,01 --> 00:00:04,09
how I work in Python Projects.

3
00:00:04,09 --> 00:00:08,04
These are lessons from more than 20 years of doing so.

4
00:00:08,04 --> 00:00:12,01
I hope it will save you time and make you more efficient.

5
00:00:12,01 --> 00:00:13,06
As you go back to work,

6
00:00:13,06 --> 00:00:15,07
try to think of what you've learned here,

7
00:00:15,07 --> 00:00:18,04
and, little by little, implement it.

8
00:00:18,04 --> 00:00:21,09
Structure your code better, write down your dependencies,

9
00:00:21,09 --> 00:00:23,08
write better tests.

10
00:00:23,08 --> 00:00:27,09
In time, you'll find out that your code is in better quality

11
00:00:27,09 --> 00:00:31,06
and the overall productivity of your team has improved.

12
00:00:31,06 --> 00:00:33,05
