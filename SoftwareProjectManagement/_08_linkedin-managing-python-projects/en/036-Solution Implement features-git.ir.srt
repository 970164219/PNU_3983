00:00:00,00 --> 00:00:06,00
(energetic music)

2
00:00:06,00 --> 00:00:08,02
- [Instructor] We start by going to the issues tab

3
00:00:08,02 --> 00:00:11,01
and clicking on your issue.

4
00:00:11,01 --> 00:00:17,02
Let's say create sentencize function.

5
00:00:17,02 --> 00:00:20,00
And here we write a description.

6
00:00:20,00 --> 00:00:26,05
Create a sentencize[text] function

7
00:00:26,05 --> 00:00:31,07
that will split text to sentences.

8
00:00:31,07 --> 00:00:39,02
Splits on the dot, exclamation mark, and question mark.

9
00:00:39,02 --> 00:00:40,08
I can have a look at the preview.

10
00:00:40,08 --> 00:00:42,05
This looks nice.

11
00:00:42,05 --> 00:00:45,04
I will assign it to myself.

12
00:00:45,04 --> 00:00:48,00
And I will submit a new issue.

13
00:00:48,00 --> 00:00:51,00
This is issue number six.

14
00:00:51,00 --> 00:00:53,06
So now I can go to my code

15
00:00:53,06 --> 00:01:02,00
and git checkout -b issue/6-sentencize

16
00:01:02,00 --> 00:01:03,09
and now I'm writing my code.

17
00:01:03,09 --> 00:01:06,09
Adding new code, changing code.

18
00:01:06,09 --> 00:01:10,01
For example here, I'm going to add the new code

19
00:01:10,01 --> 00:01:14,05
for sentencize and save the file.

20
00:01:14,05 --> 00:01:17,09
I can do git status to check and see

21
00:01:17,09 --> 00:01:22,06
that I have one modified file, and two new file.

22
00:01:22,06 --> 00:01:29,09
Before I'm going to commit, I'm going to run the tests.

23
00:01:29,09 --> 00:01:31,04
And once the tests are passing,

24
00:01:31,04 --> 00:01:33,08
I can do git add nlp

25
00:01:33,08 --> 00:01:38,08
init nlp, sentences, and test, test.

26
00:01:38,08 --> 00:01:40,02
And sentences.

27
00:01:40,02 --> 00:01:43,08
And then I do git commit -m

28
00:01:43,08 --> 00:01:50,01
add sentencize function

29
00:01:50,01 --> 00:01:52,01
And these changes are still local,

30
00:01:52,01 --> 00:01:57,04
now I need to do git push -u origin which is to github.

31
00:01:57,04 --> 00:02:04,08
And we're saying that this is issue/6-sentencize.

32
00:02:04,08 --> 00:02:09,03
This is going to push it to github.

33
00:02:09,03 --> 00:02:11,02
Now I can go back to github.

34
00:02:11,02 --> 00:02:13,03
I will click on pull requests.

35
00:02:13,03 --> 00:02:16,09
I see that I get a notification under new pull requests.

36
00:02:16,09 --> 00:02:20,00
So I can compare the pull request.

37
00:02:20,00 --> 00:02:24,04
Change the add to capital A, so it will be nicer.

38
00:02:24,04 --> 00:02:28,03
And create a pull request.

39
00:02:28,03 --> 00:02:29,08
Now I have a pull request,

40
00:02:29,08 --> 00:02:31,06
I can look at files changed,

41
00:02:31,06 --> 00:02:36,02
and see that these files are there.

42
00:02:36,02 --> 00:02:42,06
And I can collaborate by adding some comments.

43
00:02:42,06 --> 00:02:45,08
And once everything is fine, I can approve that,

44
00:02:45,08 --> 00:02:53,00
I can do a squash emerge to get the new feature in.

45
00:02:53,00 --> 00:02:54,00
And that's it.
