1
00:00:00,06 --> 00:00:02,00
- [Instructor] You should have a ReadMe file

2
00:00:02,00 --> 00:00:03,06
at your repository.

3
00:00:03,06 --> 00:00:07,00
It should provide some documentation about your project,

4
00:00:07,00 --> 00:00:10,08
and some help for new developers on how to get by.

5
00:00:10,08 --> 00:00:14,08
It's very common to write ReadMe in Markdown format.

6
00:00:14,08 --> 00:00:17,06
GitHub and other services well render this Markdown

7
00:00:17,06 --> 00:00:21,07
to nice HTML, as you can see here.

8
00:00:21,07 --> 00:00:23,08
The first lines of the ReadMe should be

9
00:00:23,08 --> 00:00:25,09
an elevator pitch for your project.

10
00:00:25,09 --> 00:00:30,04
It should explain in short terms what your project is about.

11
00:00:30,04 --> 00:00:33,06
Usually after that comes uses, examples

12
00:00:33,06 --> 00:00:35,05
and more documentation.

13
00:00:35,05 --> 00:00:38,05
At the end we usually have some data for developers

14
00:00:38,05 --> 00:00:41,06
on how to get started hacking on the project.

15
00:00:41,06 --> 00:00:43,09
ReadMe is important, don't skip it

16
00:00:43,09 --> 00:00:46,00
and make sure it's updated.
