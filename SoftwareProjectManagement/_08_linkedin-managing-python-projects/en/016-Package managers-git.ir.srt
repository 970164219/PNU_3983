00:00:00,00 --> 00:00:01,08
- [Instructor] A package manager

2
00:00:01,08 --> 00:00:03,07
will install third-party packages

3
00:00:03,07 --> 00:00:05,08
and their dependencies for you.

4
00:00:05,08 --> 00:00:10,09
Pip is the most widely used one and is a good choice.

5
00:00:10,09 --> 00:00:13,04
Pip is not the only package manager.

6
00:00:13,04 --> 00:00:22,01
There are others such as Poetry, Conda, Pipenv, and others.

7
00:00:22,01 --> 00:00:23,07
I'm going to talk about Pip,

8
00:00:23,07 --> 00:00:25,03
but the ideas here apply to other

9
00:00:25,03 --> 00:00:27,04
package managers as well.

10
00:00:27,04 --> 00:00:30,00
By default, Pip will install the latest version

11
00:00:30,00 --> 00:00:31,02
of a package.

12
00:00:31,02 --> 00:00:33,08
I highly recommend you specify which version

13
00:00:33,08 --> 00:00:36,04
of a package you want to install.

14
00:00:36,04 --> 00:00:38,05
It will save you from surprises in the future

15
00:00:38,05 --> 00:00:41,02
when someone accidentally introduces a bug

16
00:00:41,02 --> 00:00:44,04
or a change to a function parameters.

17
00:00:44,04 --> 00:00:46,01
You should also write your dependencies

18
00:00:46,01 --> 00:00:50,00
and their versions down and place this file in SuSE control

19
00:00:50,00 --> 00:00:52,05
so other team members and the operations team

20
00:00:52,05 --> 00:00:55,04
will be able to reproduce the same environment.

21
00:00:55,04 --> 00:00:57,01
Here's an example.

22
00:00:57,01 --> 00:01:00,09
This file is usually called requirements.txt.

23
00:01:00,09 --> 00:01:03,00
You can have comments like in line one

24
00:01:03,00 --> 00:01:06,01
and then in line three and four we specify the dependencies

25
00:01:06,01 --> 00:01:10,09
and we specify the version for every dependency.

26
00:01:10,09 --> 00:01:17,05
To install these requirements from Python -m pip install -r

27
00:01:17,05 --> 00:01:20,01
and our requirements file.

28
00:01:20,01 --> 00:01:22,05
Then the pip will install the dependencies

29
00:01:22,05 --> 00:01:26,00
and their dependencies.

30
00:01:26,00 --> 00:01:31,03
And now in our code we can use pandas for example.

31
00:01:31,03 --> 00:01:34,00
We put pandas as pd works.
