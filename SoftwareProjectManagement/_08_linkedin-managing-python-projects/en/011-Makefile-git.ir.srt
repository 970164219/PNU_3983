00:00:00,05 --> 00:00:02,06
- [Instructor] People tend to forget things.

2
00:00:02,06 --> 00:00:05,06
If, for example, running your tests involved

3
00:00:05,06 --> 00:00:07,02
more than one command,

4
00:00:07,02 --> 00:00:10,00
I can almost guarantee that at some point in time

5
00:00:10,00 --> 00:00:12,00
someone will forget a step.

6
00:00:12,00 --> 00:00:14,08
The best cure for this is automation.

7
00:00:14,08 --> 00:00:18,04
Once you write all the steps to run the tests in a script

8
00:00:18,04 --> 00:00:22,01
they are there, documented and ready to execute.

9
00:00:22,01 --> 00:00:25,07
There are several systems that support task automation.

10
00:00:25,07 --> 00:00:28,03
I tend to use Make utility.

11
00:00:28,03 --> 00:00:32,00
The reasons I like Make are it's simple,

12
00:00:32,00 --> 00:00:36,01
it's already installed on most Unix-like systems,

13
00:00:36,01 --> 00:00:38,09
and there's a lot of knowledge around it.

14
00:00:38,09 --> 00:00:41,08
Let's have a look at the makefile.

15
00:00:41,08 --> 00:00:45,05
In a makefile we have a rule followed by a column.

16
00:00:45,05 --> 00:00:48,07
So the rule name is test and it's followed column.

17
00:00:48,07 --> 00:00:51,04
Then, all the commands this rule should invoke

18
00:00:51,04 --> 00:00:54,06
are prefixed by the top character.

19
00:00:54,06 --> 00:00:57,09
If a line is long, you can split it with a backslash.

20
00:00:57,09 --> 00:01:01,01
We can see we have three steps for running our tests.

21
00:01:01,01 --> 00:01:03,04
First we clean the .pyc files,

22
00:01:03,04 --> 00:01:06,06
then we run the flake8 linter,

23
00:01:06,06 --> 00:01:09,09
and then the pytest test run.

24
00:01:09,09 --> 00:01:12,05
And now we can invoke it,

25
00:01:12,05 --> 00:01:15,07
make test

26
00:01:15,07 --> 00:01:19,03
and we see that every line is executed

27
00:01:19,03 --> 00:01:22,02
and finally, we run the tests.

28
00:01:22,02 --> 00:01:24,09
It might be that Make is not the right system for you,

29
00:01:24,09 --> 00:01:28,00
though I encourage you to give it a try.

30
00:01:28,00 --> 00:01:29,00
If you can't use Make,

31
00:01:29,00 --> 00:01:32,00
try to find another automation system.
