00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:01.060
- [Instructor] Let's take a moment now

2
00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:04.020
to discuss the solutions framework.

3
00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.040
You recall from the beginning of this course,

4
00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:10.010
we had the three main factors of people,

5
00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:13.000
process, and technology to consider

6
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.090
as we put together how change management

7
00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:17.020
is performed in an agile

8
00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:19.050
new project development environment.

9
00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.070
Let's take a look at each one of theses in turn

10
00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.070
through the lens of what the solution looks like.

11
00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.050
First, from a technology standpoint,

12
00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:29.010
we know that we should have model

13
00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.000
and drawing viewing capabilities.

14
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.030
This is easy to implement

15
00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.000
and the solutions are readily available.

16
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Next, we discussed model-based design.

17
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.010
Model-based design is a way to incorporate more information

18
00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.040
into the design documents that are being created

19
00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.000
so that the stakeholders have easier access

20
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.060
to information in a central repository.

21
00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:52.020
This is a good thing to do

22
00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.090
and it supports the agile methodologies.

23
00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.070
We also discussed using digital design reviews

24
00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.020
and the importance of capturing information

25
00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.030
that happens during a design review

26
00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.040
and incorporating it back into future sprints

27
00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.020
or future development efforts through the backlog.

28
00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.030
I discussed augmented reality.

29
00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.010
Augmented reality, I believe, will be a key enabler

30
00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:18.020
to keeping up with technologies

31
00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.010
and new disruptive technologies like 3D printing.

32
00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:23.060
Augmented reality is beginning to be used

33
00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.050
in industry for design reviews

34
00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:27.040
and I think it will be used much more widely

35
00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.040
in the very near future.

36
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.020
And of course, we have data management tools

37
00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.040
like libraries and discussion forums.

38
00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.000
I firmly believe that communication

39
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.010
is one of the most important aspects

40
00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:41.060
that you as a project management professional

41
00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.080
in the new product development environment can foster.

42
00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.010
And the ability to capture information

43
00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:50.020
in a way that can be shared is important

44
00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.030
and the way to capture and facilitate discussion

45
00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:54.060
is very important.

46
00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.060
Particularly, in our modern world

47
00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.060
where we have geographically dispersed teams

48
00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.020
and many stakeholders who work

49
00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.020
in very different geographies and timezones.

50
00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.070
Now we can discuss process.

51
00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.020
From a process standpoint,

52
00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.000
we've gone through a few of these already

53
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.040
and we'll talk more about them

54
00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.070
in the case study at the end of this course.

55
00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:17.000
But really model-based design is important.

56
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.010
Model-based design, you could say it's a technology

57
00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.060
but it is also a process in the way

58
00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.020
you capture information and reuse it.

59
00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:24.090
Of course, digital design reviews

60
00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.000
are a technology and a process.

61
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.020
We discussed a little bit about

62
00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.010
how they can be optimally used

63
00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.040
and how with the new disruptive technologies

64
00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.060
they're coming in the form of 3D printing,

65
00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.070
we need to do more digital design reviews

66
00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:39.020
even earlier in the process.

67
00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:42.000
Of course, library management is important.

68
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.040
One of the core tenets of agile is that artifacts

69
00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.090
are stored in a fashion that lets them be easily reusable.

70
00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.060
And this is also very similar to the lean concepts

71
00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.030
which put a premium on making sure

72
00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.040
that things are orderly and things are categorized properly.

73
00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.030
And then we get the people.

74
00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.000
People, I believe, is the most important component

75
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.010
of the three that we discussed so far.

76
00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.040
We know intrinsically that a team

77
00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.010
that communicates effectively functions well.

78
00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.070
So as a professional project manager

79
00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:16.010
in this new product development world,

80
00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:17.050
you should do everything that you can

81
00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:19.080
to make sure that the team is communicating

82
00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:23.010
in a way that supports the new product development efforts.

83
00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.050
Motivational speaker, Tony Robbins, said,

84
00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:27.060
"To effectively communicate, we must realize

85
00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.080
"that we are all different in the way we perceive the world

86
00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:31.090
"and use this understanding

87
00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.030
"as a guide to our communications with others."

88
00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.070
I found as a practicing professional

89
00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:40.090
that the agile mindset and the velocity

90
00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:43.020
in which decisions need to be made to support

91
00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:46.030
the agile methodologies can be very challenging.

92
00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:49.040
So what you need to do is ensure that all the stakeholders

93
00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.080
understand the communications efforts that are going on,

94
00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:57.000
who to communicate with, and how to get things done.

95
00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.060
Similarly, in a quote from Stephen Covey,

96
00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:02.030
he said famously, "Two people can see the same thing,

97
00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:04.020
"disagree, and yet both be right.

98
00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:06.080
"It's not logical, it's psychological."

99
00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:10.070
In the early phases of agile new product development,

100
00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:13.020
when changes are happening very rapidly,

101
00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:17.000
this psychological component often rears its head.

102
00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.030
You need to ensure again that communications

103
00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:22.090
are happening clearly, that information is available

104
00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:26.000
simply for the stakeholders to make the decisions

105
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.050
that they're being requested to make

106
00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:29.000
on a very short time period.
