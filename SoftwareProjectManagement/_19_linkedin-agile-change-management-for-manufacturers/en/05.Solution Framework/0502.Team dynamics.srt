00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.050
- [Instructor] Let's take a moment now

2
00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:03.010
to discuss team dynamics,

3
00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:06.000
particularly related to communications

4
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.050
amongst the new product development teams.

5
00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:11.020
I'm going to be referencing a wealth of information

6
00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:12.020
that's available through

7
00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:15.000
the International Journal of Business Communication,

8
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.040
who has done many studies related to this,

9
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:18.080
and has provided a lot of guidance

10
00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.060
to international teams.

11
00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.060
One of the interesting components of communication

12
00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:25.030
that the International Journal found

13
00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:27.090
is that the manner of communication used by team members

14
00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.030
becomes more asynchronous

15
00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:31.060
as their geographic separation grows.

16
00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.010
Now, this makes perfect sense,

17
00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.040
because as the geographic separation grows,

18
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.030
their time separation probably grows, too,

19
00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.000
so, if they're in different time zones.

20
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
What they also found was that, as the graph shows here,

21
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.080
communication mediums like phone and instant messaging

22
00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.090
become less important as geographic separation grows,

23
00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:51.090
and things like email and discussion forums

24
00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.030
become important.

25
00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.000
Many of the collaboration and data management tools

26
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.040
that we have available on the market

27
00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.040
have built-in discussion forums.

28
00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.060
I encourage you to leverage those and use those,

29
00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:05.030
because that's a great way to incorporate

30
00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.010
discussion about the project and the product

31
00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:11.080
into the actual body of knowledge

32
00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.030
captured and stored in the central repository.

33
00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.000
This, of course, facilitates agile

34
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.010
by helping provide direct information

35
00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:22.010
to the stakeholders at the time and place

36
00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:24.000
they need to make a decision.

37
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
The International Journal also found

38
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.090
that this asynchronous communication

39
00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.040
produced a lot more discourse on the functions related

40
00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.060
to the question types and strategies.

41
00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.010
What this means is,

42
00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:35.070
the stakeholders were talking about

43
00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.080
what they actually needed to be talking about,

44
00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.020
which is kind of curious.

45
00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.040
What we need to do is provide them some guidance

46
00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.010
on how to address these challenges

47
00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:45.070
and how to most effectively communicate.

48
00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.040
Also, the International Journal found

49
00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.000
that the preferred language for international projects

50
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.050
with multicultural teams is international English.

51
00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.010
As a practicing professional,

52
00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:57.050
I can vouch for this, that most of the time,

53
00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.010
the fallback language for international

54
00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:03.030
and multicultural teams is international English.

55
00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.000
So, what we need to do is train

56
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.090
the geographically dispersed team members

57
00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.060
on the language and grammar used in international English.

58
00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.030
The scope of that is certainly beyond this course,

59
00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:15.090
but there are many fine sources

60
00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.040
for training on international English.

61
00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.090
What you should also do

62
00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.090
is train your team members to speak specifically

63
00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.000
and write in unambiguous questions and feedback.

64
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.020
This helps as the teams are struggling

65
00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:32.000
to overcome the distance and time separations.

66
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.090
The International Journal also pointed out

67
00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.000
that intercultural teams perform best

68
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.050
when each culture is informed

69
00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.050
of the communications and engagement method and format

70
00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.040
preferred by the others.

71
00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.030
It's very good at the beginning of a project

72
00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.000
to establish some ground rules and set some expectations

73
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.070
about how communication happens.

74
00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.010
To that point,

75
00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.010
the team's communication should be based on a standard.

76
00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.090
In the standard,

77
00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.070
you should have things

78
00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:57.040
like the granularity of the discourse,

79
00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.030
explaining that short questions or short answers

80
00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:01.090
are not necessarily appropriate

81
00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.010
unless they're the only option available.

82
00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.030
You should also explain the cadence,

83
00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.000
how frequently communication should happen,

84
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.020
how quickly responses should be expected, and so forth,

85
00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:14.090
so that the entire team can perform

86
00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:16.070
to the set of expectations,

87
00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:21.000
thus improving the agile new product development process.
