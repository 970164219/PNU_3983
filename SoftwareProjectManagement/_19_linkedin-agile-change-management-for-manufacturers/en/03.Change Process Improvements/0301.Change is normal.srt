00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.030
- [Instructor] As we discussed in the previous chapter

2
00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:05.010
of this course, you may need to begin your journey

3
00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:08.080
into Agile new product development change management

4
00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:12.040
by giving your business an introduction or a refresher

5
00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:17.020
into the Agile methodology, and Agile vocabulary.

6
00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:20.020
Similarly, we reviewed that the business users

7
00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.040
may be thinking about requirements

8
00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.000
and not necessarily in tune

9
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.070
with the way that you formulate your actual work,

10
00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.020
and your actual work breakdown structure under Agile.

11
00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:32.010
As Socrates reminds us,

12
00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:34.040
the secret to success is letting go of the old

13
00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.060
and embracing the new paradigm.

14
00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:40.080
Let's discuss how you can facilitate such a transformation.

15
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.040
To begin with, remind your stakeholders

16
00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.080
and your project team that you want

17
00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.070
to deliver a product, and you think

18
00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.010
to deliver a product, not documentation.

19
00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:53.050
Now clearly as we discussed earlier in this course,

20
00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.050
some documentation's very important,

21
00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.090
and some documentation is dictated

22
00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.000
by regulating bodies in government agencies.

23
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.050
So you cannot get away with doing no documentation

24
00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:04.080
for a physical product.

25
00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.050
But you want to make sure that you are minimizing

26
00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:10.040
the documentation done and the documentation

27
00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.030
that is done is done in a very efficient manner.

28
00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.020
You also need to make your project team comfortable,

29
00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.070
with the fact that you sometimes need

30
00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.000
to stop, assess, and re-plan product requirements

31
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
in an Agile methodology.

32
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.030
Because a core tentative Agile

33
00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.060
is that you begin building things

34
00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.050
or you begin working on the design,

35
00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.060
before all the requirements are known.

36
00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:35.060
This is very different

37
00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.020
from the traditional waterfall methodology.

38
00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.080
Again, another difference in Agile,

39
00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.000
you purposely delay decisions.

40
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.060
This can be very foreign to folks familiar

41
00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.000
with the traditional waterfall methodology,

42
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.020
in which, a known unmade decision is viewed as a risk.

43
00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.090
Another big part of Agile is involving the customer

44
00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.090
and involving the customer early on,

45
00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.030
even in the change process.

46
00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.000
The companies that are using

47
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.010
Agile methodologies most effectively,

48
00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:08.070
are on those that are leveraging change

49
00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:10.060
as a competitive advantage.

50
00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.090
Now viewing it as something that they have to do

51
00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.010
but something that they almost want to do,

52
00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.060
so that they can satisfy the customer

53
00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.060
and come out with a more optimized design.

54
00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.090
Another technique based on industry best practices

55
00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.070
is to make your product modular.

56
00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:28.080
Making a product modular does have some costs,

57
00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.000
in that you need to define the interfaces.

58
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.050
But it also adds some benefits,

59
00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:35.000
in that it allows you to fence in change.

60
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.060
Later on this chapter, we will have an example

61
00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.000
of how a well known manufacturer

62
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.070
is using the idea of modular projects

63
00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:45.080
to create their designs in a manner

64
00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.040
that fences in change,

65
00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.010
allowing them to freely make changes to styling for example,

66
00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.000
but not make changes to structural components.
