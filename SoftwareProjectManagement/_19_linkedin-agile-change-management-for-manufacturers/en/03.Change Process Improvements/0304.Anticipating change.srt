- [Instructor] In the Agile Project Management

2
00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:04.040
For New Product Development course,

3
00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:07.000
we discussed the process through which backlog items

4
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.060
get turned into products.

5
00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:11.060
This is the standard agile sprint methodology.

6
00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:13.080
In this course, we introduce the importance

7
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.060
of anticipating change.

8
00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:17.040
If we consider that this diagram

9
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.080
shows a typical running agile project,

10
00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.090
we know that changes are invariably brought up,

11
00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:26.010
usually at the worst time.

12
00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.070
We want to ensure that the potential change

13
00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.020
that's brought up does not impact

14
00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:34.000
the current running sprint.

15
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Rather, we want to move that potential change

16
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.010
into the backlog planning so that it gets planned

17
00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.060
into the subsequent sprint, or sprints.

18
00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:46.010
In such a fashion, we ensure that the change

19
00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.090
is accounted for and even anticipated,

20
00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.070
but does not turn into churn,

21
00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.000
by altering the existing running sprint.
