00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.030
- [Narrator] The agile methodology, embraces, and stresses

2
00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.000
the complexity of project delivery by implementing

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.030
empirical process control. Or essentially what we'd call

4
00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.050
closed-loop feedback. We've discussed this several times

5
00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:15.020
in the course already. But I wanted to take just a moment,

6
00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:18.040
and illustrate what this might look like as a project

7
00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:23.000
moves along, and as the design moves further in maturity.

8
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.040
Very similar to the very generic example we had

9
00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.040
with the University study a few minutes ago.

10
00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.090
In this case, what we have.

11
00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.080
Is we have a series of running sprints.

12
00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:36.000
So a design is underway. In this case,

13
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.030
as an early prototype is tested we get feedback

14
00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.080
from various stakeholders indicating the performance

15
00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.090
of the design, indicating some feedback about what

16
00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.080
could be changed. And even,

17
00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.050
as we can see from the stakeholder on the left.

18
00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.070
indicating what might be possible to change.

19
00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.040
So a properly functioning,

20
00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.080
agile new product development team is able to bring

21
00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.080
feedback, and suggestions together

22
00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.060
in the design review meetings.

23
00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:07.040
Now as this design moves along, and as we go through

24
00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.080
another set of sprints or perhaps several other sprints,

25
00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.020
we get more feedback, we get more refined designs,

26
00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.090
and we continue using this closed loop feedback.

27
00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.000
This information should be stored so that it can be

28
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.040
reused later, and recalled.

29
00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.010
This middle phase again is typically where we would use

30
00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:27.080
a formal design review tool of some type.

31
00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.070
And we'd be capturing that information,

32
00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.000
and keeping it under revision control.

33
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.020
As we move further to the right in time,

34
00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.020
or further along in time,

35
00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.020
the design runs through a series of sprints again.

36
00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.030
And what we find is that we get very near the final product,

37
00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.070
or we get the completed product.

38
00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.070
Feedback from the testers indicates that it meets

39
00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.060
all the requirements, and the design professionals agree

40
00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.080
that the design can be frozen.

41
00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.000
So a couple things I want to point out here at this time.

42
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
As you would expect, any changes moving forward

43
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.080
would have to be handled through a formal

44
00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.010
change management process, not a design review process.

45
00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:10.090
Similarly I think it's important to note that the design

46
00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:15.060
team, or the product development team is agreeing on things

47
00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.010
in this process. It's very important that as a manager

48
00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.020
of agile new product development projects,

49
00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.050
that you seek to have agreements, and that you seek

50
00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.070
to have decisions made at the time that they can be made,

51
00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:32.000
and by the stakeholders most empowered to make them.
