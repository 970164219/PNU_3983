00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.010
- [Instructor] As we just discussed,

2
00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:04.090
building in the idea if anticipating change

3
00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:07.020
is a very solid practice.

4
00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.030
To further refine this idea,

5
00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.060
we need to discuss fencing in change.

6
00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:15.030
Fencing in change is a technique

7
00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.080
used in Agile New Product Development

8
00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.020
to help mitigate one of the primary risks

9
00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.040
of the Agile New Product Development system,

10
00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.070
which is changed propagation due to coupling.

11
00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:29.050
In simple terms, change propagation due to coupling means

12
00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:34.050
that any particular change made may have a ripple effect

13
00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.070
or may impact other components or other parts of the design

14
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.090
that caused changes to be propagated.

15
00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:43.040
As you can probably imagine,

16
00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.090
this can even cause an endless loop of changes.

17
00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.070
So, it can be very difficult to maintain

18
00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:50.060
and it can be very, very costly,

19
00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.080
and in fact can go well beyond the benefits gained

20
00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.090
by using the Agile New Product Development methodologies.

21
00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:00.060
So, let's take a look at an actual example of this.

22
00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:02.010
In this particular case,

23
00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.060
we have the design of a car door

24
00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:07.060
from a well-known automobile manufacturer.

25
00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.080
In the simplest fashion to describe this design,

26
00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.040
we have an inner skin

27
00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:17.020
which is where all the interior cosmetic parts attached to.

28
00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:18.060
We have an outer skin

29
00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.010
which is what defines the outside style of the vehicle.

30
00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:24.020
And we have a structural component,

31
00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:25.050
shown here in red,

32
00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:28.000
which is the component that has been validated

33
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.080
according to the automobile's safety and crash standards.

34
00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.070
What we want to do is we want to ensure

35
00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.030
that changes made for cosmetic reasons

36
00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.060
don't accidentally impact the structural component.

37
00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.080
So, what this manufacturer did

38
00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.030
is they chose to focus on the structural component

39
00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.060
as well as the interface components,

40
00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.040
shown here in yellow.

41
00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.020
In such a fashion,

42
00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.020
what they have done is they have set up a rule

43
00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.040
so no changes can be made to the structural component

44
00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.090
since it's a validated and governed by industry regulations.

45
00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.090
Conversely, they have said that changes

46
00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.010
to the interface components can be freely made

47
00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:10.060
since they act simply as attachment points

48
00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.070
to the other components of the door design.

49
00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:18.040
In such a fashion, this manufacturer was able to contain

50
00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.000
where changes can happen

51
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.070
and therefore ensure that propagation of changes

52
00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:27.000
through coupling does not happen.
