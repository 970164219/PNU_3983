00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.010
- [Instructor] Given what we just discussed,

2
00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:04.010
there would seem to be many factors involved

3
00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:07.050
in adopting Agile methodologies for new product development.

4
00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:09.040
Aachen University in Germany performed

5
00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.090
an exhaustive study of leading manufacturers

6
00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:15.000
who had adopted Agile, or Agile-like methodologies,

7
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.010
particularly for change management.

8
00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.050
And the results can provide us

9
00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.060
with some interesting analysis.

10
00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:22.070
First, when viewed as a graph,

11
00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.070
comparing product maturity to rigor,

12
00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.020
the study found that leading companies

13
00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:32.000
are able to progressively introduce rigor

14
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.080
into their processes and into

15
00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:37.050
their new product development methodologies.

16
00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.070
How linear this rigor can be introduced

17
00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.020
seems influenced by a number of factors.

18
00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.010
The study found, interestingly,

19
00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.000
that there were typically three plateaus,

20
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.070
although sometimes there were more or fewer.

21
00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:50.010
While the study did not say,

22
00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.030
I believe that these plateaus are actually indications

23
00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.000
that the leading companies are using

24
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.030
a Agile stage gate hybrid methodology.

25
00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.000
If you're not familiar with this hybrid methodology,

26
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.040
you can find information in it

27
00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.010
in my Agile Project Management

28
00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.030
for New Product Development course.

29
00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.030
If we dig a little bit deeper into the results

30
00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.070
of this study, Aachen University found

31
00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.030
that almost every aspect of product information

32
00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.020
from how much automation was used to produce the parts

33
00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.080
to how compliant the products are to industry standards

34
00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.080
progressed at roughly the same rate.

35
00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.020
This indicates, as Agile prescribes,

36
00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.060
that the key stakeholders are involved early

37
00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:30.080
and continuously throughout

38
00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.030
the new product development process.

39
00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.000
Now if we dig a little bit deeper,

40
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.080
specifically into the change management aspects

41
00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.040
of this paradigm, what we'll find

42
00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.010
is that the increase in rigor is very similar

43
00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:45.010
to what we've just described.

44
00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:47.060
In the beginning of the new product development process,

45
00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.050
for example, leading companies often have

46
00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:52.050
design professionals and production

47
00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:56.030
or manufacturing personnel working very closely together.

48
00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.080
They collaborate using digital tools

49
00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.080
to view actual CAD models and provide redlines and feedback

50
00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.020
in a format that can be consumed in the CAD tool.

51
00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.080
This provides a very iterative, fast,

52
00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.070
flexible environment for capturing

53
00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:13.040
those early design changes.

54
00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.060
As the product maturity increases,

55
00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.070
the paradigm slowly changes.

56
00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:20.040
In this example, we've introduced the validation

57
00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.090
and verification stakeholders to the equation.

58
00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.040
At this point, typically, change would be managed

59
00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.000
through something like a design review.

60
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
The design review is shown here as a Word document.

61
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.070
But it's generally an artifact that's stored

62
00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:38.090
in a PDM system under revision control,

63
00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.090
or it's a business object in a PDM or PLM system.

64
00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.020
Regardless, the design review artifact

65
00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:49.010
allows information to be captured and stored,

66
00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.060
under revision control, about the changes

67
00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.030
that are being applied to the product as it's maturing

68
00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.060
in kind of this middle state.

69
00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.050
Moving to the right, or moving along in time

70
00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:01.050
as the product gets very mature,

71
00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:04.060
the equation changes to where change is managed

72
00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.080
under a formal change management system,

73
00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.000
typically using engineering change requests

74
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.070
and engineering change orders and so forth.

75
00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:13.060
As you can see in this example here,

76
00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.020
we have added the regulatory stakeholders to the equation.

77
00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:19.080
Now in reality, all the stakeholders

78
00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.040
should have been involved at some level

79
00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.010
all the way along, though according to,

80
00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:28.010
and as illustrated by, that Aachen University study,

81
00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:30.070
the rigor in which they participate

82
00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:34.000
increases as we move along the maturity of the product.
