00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.060
- [Instructor] Continuing to think

2
00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:03.080
about the disconnected data that we have,

3
00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:07.080
we often lack systems, technology, or process

4
00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.050
to take feedback and incorporate it

5
00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.030
into the new product development process

6
00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:15.020
or into the actual design,

7
00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:18.010
and continuous feedback is one of the core tenets

8
00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:21.010
of the agile new product development methodology.

9
00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:22.050
So, for example,

10
00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.030
we often find things like handwritten redlines on drawings,

11
00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:30.000
even in this day and age where we have very good tools

12
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.040
for reviewing and annotating drawings.

13
00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.090
Many professionals, especially those on the shop floor,

14
00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:39.000
prefer to hand-write on printed drawings.

15
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.020
This creates a barrier,

16
00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.050
as the handwritten information

17
00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.030
needs to somehow be translated

18
00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.080
back into the design information.

19
00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:51.040
Similarly, we still very frequently see

20
00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.040
handwritten sticky notes used as riders

21
00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:58.090
or other information added on to design documentation.

22
00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:02.020
Again, this is a body of knowledge that's created

23
00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.040
that's very difficult to translate back

24
00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.030
into the core information.

25
00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.010
Plus, it creates decisions that need to be made

26
00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:11.060
by the new product development team

27
00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.060
about what to include or how to include it.

28
00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.010
Lastly, we must consider the human factor

29
00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:21.050
and acknowledge that many people have very bad handwriting.

30
00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:25.010
A lot of times, illegible or unreadable information

31
00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:27.080
is provided to the new product development team.

32
00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.030
This causes them to do either a lot of searching

33
00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.030
to find out what the original stakeholder actually meant,

34
00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.020
or worse, to make assumptions

35
00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.050
and perhaps even make bad decisions

36
00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:40.030
based on the information that they were given.

37
00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.050
These are all problems in the agile methods

38
00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:44.090
of new product development

39
00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.030
which requires that close, continuous feedback.

40
00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.050
Similarly, if we were to look at the feedback

41
00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:55.040
or the connection between pieces of information,

42
00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:56.030
just a bit ago,

43
00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.060
we discussed how different systems

44
00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.000
are used to manage data.

45
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.020
But if we look at the data itself,

46
00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:03.080
we often know that, at the core,

47
00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.090
we have a project plan.

48
00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.000
Before, we described that that may be managed

49
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.070
in a project management tool,

50
00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:13.060
but that plan itself drives a lot of activities.

51
00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.040
The activities describe

52
00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.020
to the new product development professionals

53
00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:18.060
what they need to do,

54
00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.090
and often specifically list the deliverables.

55
00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.030
The deliverables could be things like CAD models

56
00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.020
and specification documents, and so forth.

57
00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.020
This intellectual property,

58
00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:32.000
when involved in the change process,

59
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.020
needs to flow back and flow upstream

60
00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:37.090
to the other pieces of information.

61
00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.070
They need to be almost intimately connected

62
00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:43.040
so that knowledgeable decisions can be made.

63
00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.090
Having different pieces of this disconnected information

64
00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.090
makes the agile change process very difficult.

65
00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.000
What we need to do is close some of these gaps

66
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.010
both through technology and through process,

67
00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.060
as well as acknowledging the human factors,

68
00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.000
such as the poor handwriting, that we need to work on.
