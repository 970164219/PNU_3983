1
00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:01.060
- [Instructor] With the organizational

2
00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:03.010
interfaces understood,

3
00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:06.000
and even the best organizational structure in place,

4
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.080
there still may be challenges for you

5
00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.030
to completely adopt and realize value

6
00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:13.060
from the agile change management process.

7
00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:14.070
For example,

8
00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.000
one of the areas that I see all the time

9
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.070
as a practicing professional

10
00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:20.050
is that the business

11
00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.040
is very used to talking about requirements.

12
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.090
They're used to taking a list of requirements,

13
00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:27.050
generating a project plan,

14
00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.080
and executing the new product development process.

15
00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.040
When you come at them,

16
00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.030
or when you start using agile-like terms,

17
00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.070
they get very confused.

18
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.060
First, this is an opportunity for you

19
00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:43.010
to educate them again on the agile terminology,

20
00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.030
and you certainly may need to do that.

21
00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.020
But second,

22
00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.040
this is also an organizational change opportunity

23
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.030
where you need to help educate the business

24
00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.000
how the agile change management processes work.

25
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.090
Also, overlaid on this could be the organizational change

26
00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.010
that needs to happen at the macro level

27
00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:05.050
so that the extended group of stakeholders

28
00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:09.000
can participate in the new product development process

29
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.090
and understand the flow of information that's happening

30
00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.000
as driven by the agile methodologies.
