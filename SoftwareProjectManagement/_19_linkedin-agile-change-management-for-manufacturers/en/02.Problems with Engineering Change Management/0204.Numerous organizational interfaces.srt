1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.070
- [Instructor] Just as we discussed

2
00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:04.040
how accessed information is a challenge

3
00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:07.000
that many organizations struggle to overcome,

4
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.060
we ought to look at the organization itself

5
00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:13.030
and its structure and determine how well it matches up with

6
00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:16.020
the Agile methodology for new product development.

7
00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.040
As you should recall from your knowledge

8
00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:21.040
of Agile project management methodologies in general,

9
00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:25.010
there's usually a number of teams that work together

10
00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:28.020
on various components or subsystems of a design.

11
00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:29.040
And the new product development process

12
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.020
is no different from that.

13
00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:37.040
Each of these teams must have very good interfaces

14
00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.060
so that information flows quickly and accurately

15
00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:43.010
between the various stakeholders.

16
00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:48.020
This is critical for the Agile process to work.

17
00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.060
Similarly, as you should recall from your knowledge

18
00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:54.010
of Agile new product development methodologies,

19
00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:55.080
decisions are made as close

20
00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.080
to the design owner's point as possible.

21
00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.040
As such, the decisions that are made

22
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.050
must be flowed freely throughout the organization.

23
00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:08.050
This is a very different mindset from a lot of companies

24
00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:10.040
or a lot of organizations that have

25
00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.030
a very structured bureaucracy

26
00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.030
or a very structured hierarchy.

27
00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.030
In such cases, you often need to consciously overlay

28
00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.040
the Agile project management teams

29
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.030
on the corporate structure

30
00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.090
for the new product development process to work efficiently.

31
00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:30.090
This is something that will take

32
00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.090
some organizational change on your part,

33
00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:39.000
as the new product development professional, to fully enact.
