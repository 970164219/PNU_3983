00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.080
- [Instructor] So given all the guidance

2
00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:04.000
we have from the international standards

3
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.080
and the guidance we have from academic sources

4
00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.020
and other thought leaders

5
00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:12.020
why do so many project management professionals

6
00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:14.000
and new product development teams

7
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.030
say that they're biggest problem

8
00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.050
is access to data?

9
00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:19.040
Well part of it is because of the way

10
00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.040
we've chosen to implement systems

11
00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:24.000
and tools and processes to manage that data.

12
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.070
For example

13
00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:28.050
many new product development organizations

14
00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.070
put their product data in a central repository

15
00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.000
like a PLM or PDM system.

16
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
And that certainly is a good start.

17
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.050
But what they do then

18
00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.080
is they link or manage related process data,

19
00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.070
for example project plans

20
00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.090
or the actual process they will use

21
00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.010
to create the engineering designs

22
00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:50.080
in something like Microsoft Project

23
00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.070
or another project management tool.

24
00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.080
This creates barrier because the two systems

25
00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.050
are different and people need to go

26
00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.020
to two different repositories

27
00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:02.010
to make knowledgeable design decisions.

28
00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.040
Similarly they may also manage bills of materials

29
00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.050
or other tabular data in systems like Excel or Access

30
00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:13.000
or other database tools.

31
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.050
And lastly they may route process information

32
00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:20.010
or approvals in a email system like Outlook.

33
00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:22.070
In each case these are standard tools

34
00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:23.090
that can be used

35
00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.080
but they are used in a very disconnected manner.

36
00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.020
That creates many barriers

37
00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.060
for the engineering professionals

38
00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.040
that need to make knowledgeable decisions

39
00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.070
about the changes that are proposed.

40
00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:35.050
In order to become truly agile

41
00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:38.060
one must have access to all the information

42
00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.050
that's needed for a decision

43
00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:43.000
at the time the decision needs to be made.
