00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.010
- [Instructor] So why do we talk about change at all?

2
00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:05.060
Well, the new product development process

3
00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:09.060
is all about solving problems, and the changes are often

4
00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:11.060
the problem statements that the engineering

5
00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:13.090
and design professionals use as input

6
00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:15.090
for the design tasks.

7
00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:19.040
A change may describe some new intellectual property

8
00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.040
that has to be created, a new design that has

9
00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:26.000
to be created based on customer requirements, and so forth.

10
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.090
Conversely, a change may arise from,

11
00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:31.050
shall we say, opportunities of a product

12
00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.090
that's not performing up to expectations in the field.

13
00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.030
Despite the fact that change is at the very core

14
00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.070
of engineering, it also elicits a lot of emotions

15
00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.080
amongst the stakeholders involved in the change process.

16
00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.090
In this course, we'll examine how change

17
00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.090
can be leveraged in an Agile new product

18
00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.090
development environment and how to make change

19
00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:53.010
a bit less painful along the way.

20
00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.040
If we continue exploring this concept

21
00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.020
of why change is painful, we can even trace

22
00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.060
some of the roots back to the education

23
00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:03.000
that engineering professionals get.

24
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.090
For example, according to Syracuse University's

25
00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:08.070
Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering,

26
00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.060
leading texts say that by controlling change,

27
00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.050
you control cost, so it is a vital organ

28
00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:18.040
of the business and should be run efficiently.

29
00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.020
One can see from this quote how change

30
00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.060
is being positioned and used not only

31
00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.060
as a restrictive measure for engineering,

32
00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.000
but as a cost control measure for the business.

33
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.030
Similarly, the Institute of Product Development

34
00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.080
at the Technical University of Munich, Germany,

35
00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.090
says that the leading text describes

36
00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.080
the reason for change is for controlling

37
00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.000
design changes is to restrict

38
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.010
the otherwise limitless creativity of designers

39
00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:49.090
in order to keep the design

40
00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.060
within the budget and time-scale.

41
00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.050
Again, change is being positioned

42
00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.020
as a very restrictive measure

43
00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:01.030
as opposed to an Agile-mindset-like opportunity

44
00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.080
to involve customers, to define customer requirements,

45
00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.080
and to create greater customer satisfaction.

46
00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.070
So we need to look at how we can reposition change

47
00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:15.060
in the Agile mindset, but there's slightly more

48
00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.030
that we need to consider first.

49
00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.000
Another reason change is viewed as painful

50
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
is because there are many International Standards

51
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.010
that have very specific requirements around change.

52
00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:33.040
For example, if we were to look at the ISO 13485 documents

53
00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.060
which describe the new product development processes

54
00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.030
and change processes in the medical device industry

55
00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:46.010
and the ISO 16949 documentation

56
00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:47.090
that describes similar processes

57
00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.010
in the automotive supply chain industry,

58
00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.030
we would find a lot of commonalities.

59
00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.080
Some of the commonalities and some of the major findings

60
00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.080
related to change is that the standards require

61
00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.000
all design changes to be documented

62
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.020
before their implementation.

63
00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:07.070
Now this is definitely at odds with the Agile mindset

64
00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:10.030
that says documentation should be secondary

65
00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.060
and the final product is what you're really working towards.

66
00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.070
Similarly, the standards require that all design changes

67
00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:21.070
are to be reviewed and approved by authorized personnel

68
00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:23.070
before their implementation.

69
00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:27.030
Again, this is out of alignment with the Agile mindset

70
00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.040
of making changes and making improvements

71
00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:34.030
as you go along so that the product evolves very rapidly.

72
00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.060
And lastly about International Standards,

73
00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.030
The International Standards prescribes some other

74
00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:42.070
requirements of the change process.

75
00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:45.050
So these standards as we've just described

76
00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:48.090
dictate that the design needs to be documented

77
00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.000
before any change is implemented

78
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.060
and that the change process needs to be reviewed

79
00:03:54.060 --> 00:04:00.010
by a number of named personnel or named roles.

80
00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:03.010
As such, industry has responded by creating

81
00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:04.040
a number of artifacts.

82
00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.080
We have problem reports and change requests,

83
00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.010
and many of the artifacts that you're familiar with

84
00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:11.060
from the new product development process.

85
00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:14.020
Again, this is a lot of documentation

86
00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:15.070
that is out of alignment with the way

87
00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:18.060
Agile would prescribe change to be handled.

88
00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.010
Similarly, the roles of the people involved

89
00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:22.070
are very prescribed.

90
00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.070
Again, this is out of alignment with Agile's idea

91
00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:28.090
that teams should ad hoc come together,

92
00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:31.050
work on a particular aspect of the design,

93
00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:33.010
make decisions about the design

94
00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:36.000
at a very granular level, and then move on.
