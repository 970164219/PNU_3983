00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.060
- [Instructor] This course deals,

2
00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:04.010
with the concepts related to change management

3
00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:07.000
in an agile new product development environment.

4
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.070
I'm a strong proponent in viewing challenges

5
00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:11.070
like this in a holistic manner,

6
00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.040
ensuring that the people, the processes,

7
00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:18.060
and the technology challenges, are addressed.

8
00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.050
This means we're striving for an environment

9
00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:23.020
in which all three of these factors

10
00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:25.050
are optimized and maximized.

11
00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.080
So how do we get there from here?

12
00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.000
Well we get there by creating another Venn diagram

13
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.040
of course, well no, not really,

14
00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.050
but a Venn diagram's helpful to discuss the path forward.

15
00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.000
To maximize your learning potential for this course,

16
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.020
you should have a solid understanding

17
00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.010
of the agile project management methodology.

18
00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:44.080
There are many fine courses available

19
00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.010
on the subject of agile project management,

20
00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.080
and in addition, my course on

21
00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.060
agile project management for new product development

22
00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:54.090
can provide a good foundation for this course.

23
00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.030
You should also be comfortable

24
00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.060
with the new product development processes,

25
00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:01.010
and particularly, the change management

26
00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.070
processes and techniques used for new product development.

27
00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.090
Lastly, this course will integrate

28
00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.040
organizational leadership concepts into your learning,

29
00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.090
so we'll pay particular attention

30
00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.010
to a few key areas around organizational leaderships

31
00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:19.010
and the soft skills necessary

32
00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:22.000
to successfully implement these techniques.
