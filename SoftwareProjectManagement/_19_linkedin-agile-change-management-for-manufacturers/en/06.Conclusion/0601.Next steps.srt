00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.090
- [Mark] As we come to the conclusion of this course,

2
00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:04.070
let's discuss a few next steps

3
00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:06.080
that you could potentially take.

4
00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.000
First, continue expanding your use of agile.

5
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.060
Remember the techniques and tools

6
00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:13.010
that we discussed in this course,

7
00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:15.030
but also remember the human factors.

8
00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.070
I find that the human interaction,

9
00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.030
or the soft skills necessary to work together

10
00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:22.050
as a functioning agile team,

11
00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.000
are very important to train and to stress.

12
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.020
So as an organizational leader,

13
00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:31.050
you may want to put additional focus on the team aspects of

14
00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.020
your new product development processes.

15
00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.080
I found in my life as a practicing professional

16
00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.000
that we can always make the technology work,

17
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.030
but getting your teams to function

18
00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.030
is much more difficult sometimes.

19
00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.030
That being said, technology is an important

20
00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.080
component of what we've been describing here.

21
00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.020
Examine your PLM investments,

22
00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.010
and examine how your PLM system

23
00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:53.060
has been configured and set up.

24
00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:56.020
In the case studies that we just went through,

25
00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:58.000
we examined how we can use libraries

26
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.050
and model-based design and basically

27
00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.080
put together a very efficient data management solution

28
00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:07.010
that's using some of these containers in different ways.

29
00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:09.010
This is all done to foster

30
00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.030
the agile change management methodologies

31
00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.050
that you need to become very good

32
00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:17.080
at using agile in your new product development processes.

33
00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.000
I encourage you to look at how your systems

34
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
are configured and how you're using them,

35
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.010
and tie it back in with things like training

36
00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:26.020
and learning and adoption,

37
00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:27.040
to make sure that you're using them

38
00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.030
to their fullest potential.

39
00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:30.090
Please follow me on LinkedIn,

40
00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.090
I tend to worry more about the

41
00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.060
organizational leadership aspects

42
00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.020
of what we've been discussing on LinkedIn,

43
00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.020
and that would be good supplemental information

44
00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.090
for you as we move along.

45
00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.080
And lastly, thank you very much for attending,

46
00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.000
I hope you enjoyed it, and found it worthwhile.
