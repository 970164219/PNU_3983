00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.090
- [Instructor] Manufacturers are constantly being asked

2
00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:04.060
to produce more complex products

3
00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:07.030
in a shorter period of time, and this puts a lot of pressure

4
00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:09.080
on manufacturers, as you might expect.

5
00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.010
The market research firm Tech-Clarity found

6
00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:15.080
that in one of their surveys, 42% of manufacturers

7
00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.080
cited increasing design reuse as a top priority.

8
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.090
The research firm CIMdata did a similar survey

9
00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.030
and found that the number one effort

10
00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:27.080
that manufacturers are undertaking is to improve

11
00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.080
engineering to manufacturing exchange

12
00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.060
for a more efficient production process.

13
00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:36.020
And another similar study by Tech-Clarity, again,

14
00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.000
found that 49% of manufacturers say that designing

15
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.010
platform variants is a top challenge for them.

16
00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.080
The response to these pressures has been to seek ways

17
00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:48.080
to reduce complexity and create logical relationships

18
00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.040
between different parts of the product's body of knowledge,

19
00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.030
which led to the design, or led to the creation

20
00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.010
of model-based design paradigms.

21
00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.010
So, if we're going to discuss change in an Agile

22
00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:02.050
environment, we really ought to include some level

23
00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:06.040
of discussion on model-based design in the conversation,

24
00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.020
though many organizations have shied away

25
00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.050
from model-based design because of the perceived

26
00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:13.080
complexity and the effort required.

27
00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.020
And to be clear, there is some effort required

28
00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.000
to set up a model-based design paradigm.

29
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.010
But in my view, a model-based design

30
00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:23.010
paradigm can start simply.

31
00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.040
It's, after all, a set of related product information

32
00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.040
that helps to define, design, and document

33
00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.060
the new product being developed.

34
00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.010
To support change management in an Agile environment,

35
00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:38.070
all the related information needs

36
00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.020
to be together and accessible.

37
00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.080
So, really, a model-based design paradigm

38
00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.010
supports Agile change very well.

39
00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:48.070
Now, with this streamlined or pared-down view

40
00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.000
of what a model-based design is,

41
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.060
we can take a look at some of the components

42
00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.030
that would actually go into the model itself

43
00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.050
and the model definition itself.

44
00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.030
To be sure, as you would expect,

45
00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.090
3-D CAD models fall in the definition.

46
00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.040
The 3-D CAD model designs the geometry

47
00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.090
of the actual part when it's complete.

48
00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.030
There's also geometric dimensioning

49
00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.020
and tolerancing information.

50
00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.010
GD&T information is often read right from the model

51
00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.060
by the manufacturing processes, so it makes sense

52
00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.010
to include it in the model, as well.

53
00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.060
There certainly should be a bill of materials,

54
00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.000
which is what is ultimately produced.

55
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.040
There may be other technical data packages

56
00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.030
that go together to help refine the understanding

57
00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.030
of the model or capture other intellectual

58
00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.070
property aspects of the model.

59
00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:35.060
Interestingly, some organizations have called this

60
00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.000
digital product definition in an effort

61
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.020
to the the streamlined model-based design

62
00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:43.010
and separate it from the much more complex

63
00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.060
model-based enterprise definitions that cause people angst.

64
00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.070
If we take a look, then, at what a simplified

65
00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:53.000
model-based design could be, it could be something as simple

66
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.060
as our project plan that we've

67
00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.030
discussed in this course already,

68
00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.060
which contains the information about what's going to be

69
00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.050
built and who is going to build it;

70
00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:02.090
the actual CAD model and related geometry,

71
00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.040
including all the metadata on the attributes, of course;

72
00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.010
and other supporting documentation,

73
00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.020
such as the specification;

74
00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.000
And all of this would be tied together

75
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.030
in some sort of a system that allows you to efficiently

76
00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.000
surf from one piece of information to the next.
