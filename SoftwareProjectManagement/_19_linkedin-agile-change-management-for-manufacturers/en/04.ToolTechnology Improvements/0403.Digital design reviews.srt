00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.020
- [Instructor] A few times already in this course,

2
00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:05.050
we've talked about digital reviews or design reviews

3
00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:08.000
done in the digital environment.

4
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.080
I wanted to take some time now

5
00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:13.050
and discuss the importance of design reviews,

6
00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:16.040
the importance of doing them in a proper fashion,

7
00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:19.010
and how they can support the agile methodology

8
00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:22.090
and the agile change methodologies that we need to use.

9
00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.000
To begin with, I want to point out

10
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.040
that a design review is not an examination of a prototype.

11
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:30.070
Design reviews should be done

12
00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.000
well before the prototype is complete.

13
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.090
Now, of course,

14
00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.020
there is an examination of the prototype,

15
00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:36.060
as you would expect.

16
00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.070
That certainly should be done.

17
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.090
So, how do these design reviews contribute to being agile?

18
00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.070
Well, I want to take this back to very simple terms.

19
00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.010
A design review, when done properly,

20
00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.080
and a series of design reviews really is what it is,

21
00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.020
compresses time,

22
00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.020
because what you're doing

23
00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.020
is you're reducing the documentation,

24
00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:58.050
you're reducing the magnitude of the changes,

25
00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.060
and you're getting more feedback earlier on in the process.

26
00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:05.060
It contributes to better change management by,

27
00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:08.010
as you would expect from an agile tool,

28
00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.080
providing better information to stakeholders

29
00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.020
and allowing the stakeholders

30
00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.000
to make more knowledgeable decisions

31
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.060
at the time the decision needs to be made.

32
00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.090
Similarly, as I mentioned just a moment ago,

33
00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.070
design reviews reduce the magnitude

34
00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.060
of each individual change.

35
00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.070
Now, what this means is, there still will be changes,

36
00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.050
and you may actually do more changes

37
00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:29.080
than you would in a traditional waterfall method,

38
00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.030
but each change will be smaller.

39
00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.010
The design reviews help most

40
00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:38.020
when they're done well before costs are frozen.

41
00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.000
In a new product development environment,

42
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.060
you know that, generally,

43
00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.030
the costs are frozen when the design

44
00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.010
is maybe only 15% or 20% along.

45
00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:49.000
So, the design reviews should be done very early.

46
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.030
A recent trend, and I think something

47
00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.000
that every manufacturer should investigate very thoroughly,

48
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.030
is using augmented reality for design reviews.

49
00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.010
In the past, a design review was generally done

50
00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:01.050
by printing out a drawing

51
00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.030
and redlining it with red pens.

52
00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.060
As we moved along in our digital world,

53
00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.010
we started doing design reviews in PowerPoint,

54
00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:11.060
and I used to see many organizations

55
00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.080
spend many hours preparing PowerPoint slides

56
00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.060
for design review.

57
00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.040
As we continue to progress in our technology,

58
00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.060
the ability to redline actual CAD models on the fly

59
00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.040
became very prevalent.

60
00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.030
The next frontier or the next threshold we will cross

61
00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.010
is using augmented reality

62
00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.090
for a very immersive experience

63
00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.070
to provide that feedback from the design professionals

64
00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:35.070
during the design review.

65
00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:39.010
As a manager of the new product development process,

66
00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.010
there are several things that you can do

67
00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.080
to improve the design review effectiveness

68
00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.030
and to improve the experience

69
00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.020
of the project team doing the design reviews.

70
00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:51.060
First, make each review session effective.

71
00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.080
Make sure that you have a proper,

72
00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:57.030
well-documented agenda for the session.

73
00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.050
Make sure that you have the particular goals and objectives

74
00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:02.020
for the session identified,

75
00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:04.090
and make sure that the feedback mechanism

76
00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:07.060
is well identified as well.

77
00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.070
To that point, design reviews are most effective

78
00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:13.020
when there's a standard method

79
00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:16.010
for providing meaningful feedback.

80
00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:19.040
This allows the teams to leverage the design review

81
00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.020
and to truly be empowered by the review activities

82
00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:23.080
that are happening.

83
00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:26.000
Now I'd like to spend just a few moments

84
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.040
talking about the disruptive technology that is 3D printing

85
00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.090
and how it impacts the design review process.

86
00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.000
3D printing technology, as you know,

87
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.070
is advancing rapidly.

88
00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:39.030
In its current state, 3D printers can produce

89
00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.040
almost production-ready parts,

90
00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.000
and we know intrinsically

91
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.040
that in a generation or two of 3D printers,

92
00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.000
we'll be making production parts with 3D printers.

93
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.020
This will completely change the market expectations.

94
00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:54.070
Manufacturers will be asked to provide

95
00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:58.070
production parts from a 3D printer earlier and earlier.

96
00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:01.010
As such, remember the design review

97
00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:04.020
cannot be an analysis of a production part,

98
00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:05.060
or even a prototype part.

99
00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:08.010
It should be done well before that.

100
00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:11.000
What you need to do is build into your process

101
00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.060
early design reviews.

102
00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:16.060
I contend that 3D printing will also be an impetus

103
00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:19.060
to adopt augmented reality that we just talked about,

104
00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:22.050
because what augmented reality will allow you to do

105
00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:24.070
is compress that early time

106
00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:26.090
and get a more immersive experience

107
00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:30.000
before the design is ready to even be printed.
