00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.000
- [Instructor] In this section on tools and technologies,

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I want to start with a few observations

3
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.030
about the maturity of the tools

4
00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:09.090
that I see being used by manufacturers every day.

5
00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.090
As a practicing professional, I've noticed

6
00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:14.050
that almost every manufacturer has experimented

7
00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:17.050
with a PLM at some level, and in fact,

8
00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:20.000
I can even say that most manufacturers

9
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.080
have some sort of a data management system in place

10
00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.030
whether that be a PLM system or a PDM system.

11
00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:29.050
I can also say that most PLM systems

12
00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:32.030
are being used to really just manage data.

13
00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:35.080
In fact they are being used as PDM systems.

14
00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.040
Now the distinction between the two

15
00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.090
could be slight or could be great,

16
00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.010
but it depends on the breadth of the products.

17
00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.010
But what I'm getting at is that many PLM systems

18
00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.070
are less than optimally implemented.

19
00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.040
And I think therefore we have a great opportunity

20
00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.080
to enhance how we use them and improve

21
00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:56.060
the change processes that these manufacturers have.

22
00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:59.050
Now thinking specifically about the information

23
00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.060
and the systems that are in use.

24
00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:04.040
As a design professional, you know that a lot of information

25
00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.090
is coming in related to the product.

26
00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.030
It could be coming from requirements from customers.

27
00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.070
It could be design and analysis information

28
00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.040
from your engineering team.

29
00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.040
It could be supplier and service information.

30
00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.070
And you intrinsically know that it should be

31
00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.000
put in a vault or a central repository

32
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.040
where it can be managed and kept under revision control.

33
00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.010
This is the first level of maturity

34
00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:28.070
that many organizations plateau at.

35
00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.010
A very mature system will have different facilities,

36
00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:34.010
for example, a library.

37
00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:36.050
The library segregates information,

38
00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:38.090
and that's a core tenant of Agile

39
00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.070
in which every stakeholder should have access

40
00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.020
to the information they need at the time they need it.

41
00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.050
Library information should be the type of information

42
00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:52.020
that's widely consumed but created by few.

43
00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.020
This is differentiated from product information

44
00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.040
which the product information container

45
00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.000
should hold information related to the sellable result

46
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.040
of the new product development process.

47
00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.090
And there should be a projects facility, or container,

48
00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.070
that holds the time-related information

49
00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:11.020
about the new product development process.

50
00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:13.050
You can think of it as the project manages time,

51
00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.080
and the product manages information.

52
00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.020
Having these facilities segregating the data

53
00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.040
allows stakeholder access in a most optimal fashion.

54
00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.010
And that's really what Agile is all about.

55
00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.090
Similarly, if we think about digital collaboration

56
00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.070
in a maturity state, we need to consider

57
00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:36.040
that different stakeholders use different vocabularies.

58
00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.050
For example, in the design world,

59
00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:41.010
the engineering professionals often talk

60
00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.070
in terms of lifecycle states, or maturity states.

61
00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:47.070
They will talk about a part being in draft state,

62
00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:51.040
or prototype, or stable where the design is stable,

63
00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.030
and it can be sent out for production.

64
00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.010
And then released is the actual finished product.

65
00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.050
Of course, as we discussed earlier,

66
00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:02.080
rigor increases as the design moves along

67
00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.070
and you use the appropriate tools to manage it.

68
00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:09.080
Conversely, the production or manufacturing stakeholders

69
00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.090
speak a different language.

70
00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.020
They often refer to things in terms of effectivity

71
00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:17.020
which could either be based on a date,

72
00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:20.000
or it could based on a serial number or a lot number.

73
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.020
So to a manufacturing professional

74
00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:24.070
a component is either good to use or not,

75
00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:26.070
and there's no in-between.

76
00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:29.050
As I work with these various stakeholders

77
00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:32.060
the manufacturing professionals often tell me that they'd

78
00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:35.060
like visibility about what's coming up from engineering.

79
00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.010
They'd like to know about the projects

80
00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:39.040
that are coming so that they can plan for them.

81
00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:40.090
This is a level of collaboration

82
00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:43.080
and a level of maturity that we should strive to have

83
00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:46.010
to fully support the Agile new product

84
00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:47.090
development methodologies.

85
00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:50.050
Similarly, the engineering stakeholders

86
00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:51.080
often tell me that they'd like

87
00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.090
more feedback from manufacturing

88
00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:55.080
so that they could improve the design

89
00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.040
or they could incorporate the feedback

90
00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.050
into future sprints or even into

91
00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:01.080
other products related to it where they can

92
00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:04.030
fully utilize the lessons learned.

93
00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:06.050
By taking advantage of this information

94
00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:09.060
and leveraging it properly, you can achieve

95
00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.000
the Agile new product development process.
