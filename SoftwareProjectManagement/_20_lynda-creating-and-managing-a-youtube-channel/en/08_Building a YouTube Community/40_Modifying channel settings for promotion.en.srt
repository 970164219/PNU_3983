1
00:00:00.06 --> 00:00:03.06
- From time to time,
YouTube spotlights channels.

2
00:00:03.06 --> 00:00:05.02
Maybe it's a particular campaign

3
00:00:05.02 --> 00:00:07.04
they're looking for or a promotion.

4
00:00:07.04 --> 00:00:10.03
Now, there's no guarantee
that making your channel

5
00:00:10.03 --> 00:00:13.01
ready to promote means
you'll get promoted.

6
00:00:13.01 --> 00:00:15.07
But it's good opportunity to consider.

7
00:00:15.07 --> 00:00:17.09
What you'll do is log in to your settings

8
00:00:17.09 --> 00:00:19.08
and visit the Channel page.

9
00:00:19.08 --> 00:00:23.03
And here, you have the
ability to feature content.

10
00:00:23.03 --> 00:00:26.01
Now, in the past, YouTube has
had other featured content

11
00:00:26.01 --> 00:00:27.09
options, and from time to time,

12
00:00:27.09 --> 00:00:30.08
they bring back new
choices as they experiment.

13
00:00:30.08 --> 00:00:33.06
At this time though, the
option's a little bit limited,

14
00:00:33.06 --> 00:00:35.03
but it's still worth considering.

15
00:00:35.03 --> 00:00:40.07
If you take a look here,
under the Channel settings,

16
00:00:40.07 --> 00:00:43.06
and we go to Featured content,

17
00:00:43.06 --> 00:00:48.01
you'll see that there's an
ability to set a featured ad.

18
00:00:48.01 --> 00:00:51.01
This allows you to select
a particular video,

19
00:00:51.01 --> 00:00:53.06
and it will run it as an ad.

20
00:00:53.06 --> 00:00:56.05
Now, you'll notice here that
there are some restrictions.

21
00:00:56.05 --> 00:00:58.08
It does say that they might use your ads

22
00:00:58.08 --> 00:01:00.07
for promotional purposes.

23
00:01:00.07 --> 00:01:03.02
They do emphasize that
you own your content,

24
00:01:03.02 --> 00:01:05.09
but also that whatever
you put in your channel ad

25
00:01:05.09 --> 00:01:08.06
is something that you have the rights to.

26
00:01:08.06 --> 00:01:11.02
So this is just another
way that they're specifying

27
00:01:11.02 --> 00:01:14.05
some of the same things that
were in the Terms of Service.

28
00:01:14.05 --> 00:01:18.02
Once you agree, you can click
the button here, for Accept.

29
00:01:18.02 --> 00:01:19.08
And then, you'll be presented

30
00:01:19.08 --> 00:01:22.08
with an option to choose your channel ad.

31
00:01:22.08 --> 00:01:25.03
Now, you can search through
any of your recent videos,

32
00:01:25.03 --> 00:01:29.00
but it does need to be a
video below two minutes long.

33
00:01:29.00 --> 00:01:31.01
So what a lot of folks
will do is make something

34
00:01:31.01 --> 00:01:34.04
a little bit shorter and
smaller that they want to share.

35
00:01:34.04 --> 00:01:36.06
Easy enough, you can
find whatever you want

36
00:01:36.06 --> 00:01:38.03
to particularly pull through there,

37
00:01:38.03 --> 00:01:41.05
but pick something that
is representative to you.

38
00:01:41.05 --> 00:01:44.01
In any case, easy enough,
and you can choose

39
00:01:44.01 --> 00:01:47.06
from any of your videos
that are under two minutes.

40
00:01:47.06 --> 00:01:50.04
Or, if you know the URL for
the video you want to use,

41
00:01:50.04 --> 00:01:53.08
just paste it into the
field here at the bottom.

42
00:01:53.08 --> 00:01:56.05
When you're done, clicking
Save will add that

43
00:01:56.05 --> 00:01:58.04
as your channel ad.

44
00:01:58.04 --> 00:02:00.05
Now you will notice that featured videos

45
00:02:00.05 --> 00:02:04.00
and featured playlists
have been recently removed.

46
00:02:04.00 --> 00:02:05.07
This was a great way that YouTube

47
00:02:05.07 --> 00:02:07.08
would occasionally promote these for you,

48
00:02:07.08 --> 00:02:11.00
and you were able to select
content to be amplified.

49
00:02:11.00 --> 00:02:15.01
But, currently, this is not
available on most accounts.

50
00:02:15.01 --> 00:02:17.07
Depending upon where you
are in the Partner Program,

51
00:02:17.07 --> 00:02:20.04
you might find other
featured content options.

52
00:02:20.04 --> 00:02:23.04
But, for most users, the
channel ad is going to be

53
00:02:23.04 --> 00:02:26.04
the only choice you have at
the time of this recording.
