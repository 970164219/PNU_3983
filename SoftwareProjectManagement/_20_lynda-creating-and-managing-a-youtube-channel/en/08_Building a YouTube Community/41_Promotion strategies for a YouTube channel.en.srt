1
00:00:00.05 --> 00:00:02.07
- At the end of the day,
you don't want to sit around

2
00:00:02.07 --> 00:00:05.02
and wait for YouTube to
promote your channel.

3
00:00:05.02 --> 00:00:07.04
You need to do some leg work yourself,

4
00:00:07.04 --> 00:00:08.05
and I'd like to share with you

5
00:00:08.05 --> 00:00:10.09
some practical pieces
of advice that I found

6
00:00:10.09 --> 00:00:13.06
have been successful
strategies to raise awareness

7
00:00:13.06 --> 00:00:15.01
for a YouTube channel.

8
00:00:15.01 --> 00:00:19.03
First up, make sure you
publicize across media outlets.

9
00:00:19.03 --> 00:00:21.07
If you have access to
a traditional content,

10
00:00:21.07 --> 00:00:24.00
you can put the link up
for things like radio,

11
00:00:24.00 --> 00:00:28.00
television, websites,
newsletters, or social networks.

12
00:00:28.00 --> 00:00:29.05
In order to make things a bit easier,

13
00:00:29.05 --> 00:00:33.03
make sure your channel
URL is easy to remember,

14
00:00:33.03 --> 00:00:38.00
or you can tell people
to search for a keyword.

15
00:00:38.00 --> 00:00:39.07
If you really want to make it simple,

16
00:00:39.07 --> 00:00:42.03
consider using a shortener, like Bitly,

17
00:00:42.03 --> 00:00:44.07
to make it easier to take a long URL

18
00:00:44.07 --> 00:00:47.08
and make it easy to find.

19
00:00:47.08 --> 00:00:50.01
Also, make sure you link
your YouTube channel

20
00:00:50.01 --> 00:00:52.04
in as many places as you can.

21
00:00:52.04 --> 00:00:55.00
For example, perhaps in
your email signature,

22
00:00:55.00 --> 00:00:58.08
or your blog post signature,
or maybe in a forum signature

23
00:00:58.08 --> 00:01:01.04
if you're participating
in online communities.

24
00:01:01.04 --> 00:01:03.02
Maybe it's connected on your Twitter page,

25
00:01:03.02 --> 00:01:05.03
and over on your Facebook account.

26
00:01:05.03 --> 00:01:08.08
Taking the time to connect it
in as many places as possible

27
00:01:08.08 --> 00:01:10.09
will drive viewership.

28
00:01:10.09 --> 00:01:14.06
Also, make sure that you allow
your videos to be embedded.

29
00:01:14.06 --> 00:01:16.04
If you want to get more views,

30
00:01:16.04 --> 00:01:19.01
letting people put your
videos on their websites

31
00:01:19.01 --> 00:01:21.00
or on their social media pages

32
00:01:21.00 --> 00:01:24.04
will increase the amount of
times that people find it.

33
00:01:24.04 --> 00:01:26.08
Remember, when you start
to look at statistics,

34
00:01:26.08 --> 00:01:29.00
you can actually see what's
driving your traffic,

35
00:01:29.00 --> 00:01:32.00
and I've found that
both searches on YouTube

36
00:01:32.00 --> 00:01:35.03
and third party websites
are frequently responsible

37
00:01:35.03 --> 00:01:37.08
for many of my views.

38
00:01:37.08 --> 00:01:41.09
Taking the time to actually
tag the videos is quite useful,

39
00:01:41.09 --> 00:01:44.03
particularly if there's
products in the videos,

40
00:01:44.03 --> 00:01:48.09
or key things that people search for.

41
00:01:48.09 --> 00:01:51.06
Commenting is one way
to increase engagement,

42
00:01:51.06 --> 00:01:55.06
just keep in mind that
comments can sometimes be rude.

43
00:01:55.06 --> 00:01:57.04
Make sure you take advantage of things,

44
00:01:57.04 --> 00:02:00.01
like those cards, for polls,

45
00:02:00.01 --> 00:02:02.00
or asking open ended questions

46
00:02:02.00 --> 00:02:06.05
and inviting people to comment
on them below the video.

47
00:02:06.05 --> 00:02:08.09
A detailed description
increases the chance

48
00:02:08.09 --> 00:02:11.08
that people will find your videos,

49
00:02:11.08 --> 00:02:15.02
and remember, playlists are
one of the greatest ways

50
00:02:15.02 --> 00:02:18.00
to get people to watch multiple videos.

51
00:02:18.00 --> 00:02:20.00
Many people find video and sit back,

52
00:02:20.00 --> 00:02:21.05
and if you've got a playlist,

53
00:02:21.05 --> 00:02:24.01
instead of them bouncing over
to other people's content,

54
00:02:24.01 --> 00:02:26.07
and you losing them, you
can keep them engaged

55
00:02:26.07 --> 00:02:32.03
with your content, or your
host, or your channel.

56
00:02:32.03 --> 00:02:34.06
Contests are another good way.

57
00:02:34.06 --> 00:02:36.01
Now, you have to be careful here,

58
00:02:36.01 --> 00:02:39.04
and there are several contest
engines that make this easier,

59
00:02:39.04 --> 00:02:43.00
but if you've got a giveaway
or promotion or freebies,

60
00:02:43.00 --> 00:02:46.08
this is a great way to
get people interested,

61
00:02:46.08 --> 00:02:49.08
and Google AdWords do work for video,

62
00:02:49.08 --> 00:02:52.03
so you can drive traffic yourself.

63
00:02:52.03 --> 00:02:54.03
If you have a video that needs to be seen,

64
00:02:54.03 --> 00:02:56.01
or is strategically important,

65
00:02:56.01 --> 00:03:00.04
you can actually pay to boost
the content in Google Search.

66
00:03:00.04 --> 00:03:02.04
YouTube is deeply integrated

67
00:03:02.04 --> 00:03:04.08
across all of Google's platforms,

68
00:03:04.08 --> 00:03:07.05
so make sure where you
can put YouTube videos

69
00:03:07.05 --> 00:03:10.07
about your business, your
cause, or your organization,

70
00:03:10.07 --> 00:03:13.06
embed them into all
places where you're at.

71
00:03:13.06 --> 00:03:16.05
This includes Google properties,
like your Google Plus page,

72
00:03:16.05 --> 00:03:18.08
and your business or brand profile,

73
00:03:18.08 --> 00:03:21.06
as well as the Google My Business page.

74
00:03:21.06 --> 00:03:23.05
Additionally, make sure if you're using

75
00:03:23.05 --> 00:03:25.03
other social media platforms,

76
00:03:25.03 --> 00:03:28.02
you take advantage of
YouTube where you can.

77
00:03:28.02 --> 00:03:30.00
Now, tools like Facebook tend to favor

78
00:03:30.00 --> 00:03:32.07
their own video hosting
over YouTube these days,

79
00:03:32.07 --> 00:03:35.01
making it less likely that YouTube posts

80
00:03:35.01 --> 00:03:37.02
are going to get pushed and shared a lot,

81
00:03:37.02 --> 00:03:39.08
so you might want to use
native Facebook video,

82
00:03:39.08 --> 00:03:41.09
but many other platforms, like Twitter,

83
00:03:41.09 --> 00:03:44.04
still make YouTube a viable option

84
00:03:44.04 --> 00:03:46.03
for sharing video content.
