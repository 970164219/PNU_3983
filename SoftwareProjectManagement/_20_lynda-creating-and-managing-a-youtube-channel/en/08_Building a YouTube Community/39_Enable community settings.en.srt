1
00:00:00.06 --> 00:00:02.08
- Once you've uploaded content to YouTube,

2
00:00:02.08 --> 00:00:06.00
chances are you want
an audience to engage.

3
00:00:06.00 --> 00:00:08.01
Not just to watch, but to comment

4
00:00:08.01 --> 00:00:09.04
to share with others.

5
00:00:09.04 --> 00:00:11.01
And to do this, you need to work

6
00:00:11.01 --> 00:00:13.02
on building a community.

7
00:00:13.02 --> 00:00:15.01
Now, lets share some practical tips

8
00:00:15.01 --> 00:00:16.06
and some technical advice.

9
00:00:16.06 --> 00:00:18.02
One of the first things
you're going to need to do

10
00:00:18.02 --> 00:00:20.08
in able to have community interaction

11
00:00:20.08 --> 00:00:23.09
is to enable some of
the community settings.

12
00:00:23.09 --> 00:00:25.06
This'll make it easier for people

13
00:00:25.06 --> 00:00:27.08
to engage in your content.

14
00:00:27.08 --> 00:00:30.00
You'll do this from the Community tab

15
00:00:30.00 --> 00:00:33.00
inside of your control panel.

16
00:00:33.00 --> 00:00:40.06
Remember, simply click
and visit Creator Studio.

17
00:00:40.06 --> 00:00:44.00
Then, go to the Community tab

18
00:00:44.00 --> 00:00:47.07
and expand it, and you'll
see a lot of options.

19
00:00:47.07 --> 00:00:49.06
Now, later on we'll talk about seeing

20
00:00:49.06 --> 00:00:51.00
some of the particular things here

21
00:00:51.00 --> 00:00:53.02
for comments and messages.

22
00:00:53.02 --> 00:00:56.07
But, I'll go to Community settings.

23
00:00:56.07 --> 00:00:59.02
This is where you can
control what happens.

24
00:00:59.02 --> 00:01:02.02
So, if you want to have
additional moderators

25
00:01:02.02 --> 00:01:04.08
you can paste their channel URL in here

26
00:01:04.08 --> 00:01:07.01
so more people can be a moderator

27
00:01:07.01 --> 00:01:09.03
without having to necessarily be

28
00:01:09.03 --> 00:01:11.06
added as a manager.

29
00:01:11.06 --> 00:01:13.07
You can also go here and take a look

30
00:01:13.07 --> 00:01:16.01
if there's a need to approve certain

31
00:01:16.01 --> 00:01:18.08
users so that they are going to be

32
00:01:18.08 --> 00:01:22.01
automatically approved
to comment and post.

33
00:01:22.01 --> 00:01:25.00
This way, even if something is being held

34
00:01:25.00 --> 00:01:27.00
these folks can get through without

35
00:01:27.00 --> 00:01:29.04
being hemmed up needing to wait for

36
00:01:29.04 --> 00:01:33.04
their comments to be
approved before posting.

37
00:01:33.04 --> 00:01:35.02
If there's somebody that you decide

38
00:01:35.02 --> 00:01:37.03
that you don't want to see from because

39
00:01:37.03 --> 00:01:39.09
they routinely misbehave, you actually

40
00:01:39.09 --> 00:01:42.04
have the ability here to hide them

41
00:01:42.04 --> 00:01:48.07
so that they're commenting
but folks won't see them.

42
00:01:48.07 --> 00:01:50.09
And, you can also go in and block

43
00:01:50.09 --> 00:01:54.06
particular words or particular links.

44
00:01:54.06 --> 00:01:58.00
Now, down below are a couple
of important settings.

45
00:01:58.00 --> 00:02:01.07
This is where you decide
what happens with comments.

46
00:02:01.07 --> 00:02:04.01
Do you want to Allow all comments?

47
00:02:04.01 --> 00:02:05.05
Well, this is fine and you'll get

48
00:02:05.05 --> 00:02:07.04
a lot more engagement on your posts,

49
00:02:07.04 --> 00:02:10.08
but it means that negative
things might get through.

50
00:02:10.08 --> 00:02:14.04
Do you want to Hold potentially
inappropriate comments?

51
00:02:14.04 --> 00:02:16.03
Well, this is going to scan the content

52
00:02:16.03 --> 00:02:18.02
and try to make sure that if it thinks

53
00:02:18.02 --> 00:02:19.07
there's something offensive in it

54
00:02:19.07 --> 00:02:21.09
it's held for moderation.

55
00:02:21.09 --> 00:02:24.03
Or, turn off comments all together.

56
00:02:24.03 --> 00:02:27.09
Or, make sure that they
have to be reviewed first.

57
00:02:27.09 --> 00:02:31.00
Now, the commenting on
videos is one thing,

58
00:02:31.00 --> 00:02:33.01
but personally I disable comments

59
00:02:33.01 --> 00:02:34.07
on the channel as a whole.

60
00:02:34.07 --> 00:02:36.08
But that's up to you.

61
00:02:36.08 --> 00:02:38.04
You can also decide that you want

62
00:02:38.04 --> 00:02:40.02
to be able to create.

63
00:02:40.02 --> 00:02:42.02
You can also decide to tag people

64
00:02:42.02 --> 00:02:43.09
who have created videos.

65
00:02:43.09 --> 00:02:46.08
So, if people decide to tag you in a post

66
00:02:46.08 --> 00:02:50.05
as being a contributor or
creator you can do that.

67
00:02:50.05 --> 00:02:53.03
And you'll see by default, that messages

68
00:02:53.03 --> 00:02:55.07
in live chat are also going to be held.

69
00:02:55.07 --> 00:02:58.01
And this is currently enabled.

70
00:02:58.01 --> 00:03:00.03
But, you can turn that
off if you don't want

71
00:03:00.03 --> 00:03:01.07
them to be filtered.

72
00:03:01.07 --> 00:03:05.04
And this way, anything
that's said will go through.

73
00:03:05.04 --> 00:03:07.04
Personally, I'm a little more cautious.

74
00:03:07.04 --> 00:03:09.04
So I'm going to leave that checked.

75
00:03:09.04 --> 00:03:11.03
These settings are worth reviewing

76
00:03:11.03 --> 00:03:12.07
and you'll need to customize them

77
00:03:12.07 --> 00:03:15.08
based upon your particular needs.

78
00:03:15.08 --> 00:03:17.09
Now, if you decide to use the newer

79
00:03:17.09 --> 00:03:19.07
version of the YouTube control panel,

80
00:03:19.07 --> 00:03:21.09
there are some of these
settings over there as well.

81
00:03:21.09 --> 00:03:24.02
You'll see that there's a Comments section

82
00:03:24.02 --> 00:03:26.04
where you're able to
actually view comments.

83
00:03:26.04 --> 00:03:29.04
And this is where you can
see what's come through.

84
00:03:29.04 --> 00:03:34.02
If we go down to Settings here.

85
00:03:34.02 --> 00:03:36.02
Now, within this you'll notice that

86
00:03:36.02 --> 00:03:38.05
from the three dot menu, this is where

87
00:03:38.05 --> 00:03:41.09
you can actually decide to take individual

88
00:03:41.09 --> 00:03:43.05
people to come through.

89
00:03:43.05 --> 00:03:46.00
This is where you can say,
always approve a person

90
00:03:46.00 --> 00:03:49.08
or block a person, or mark
something for moderation.

91
00:03:49.08 --> 00:03:52.02
You'll notice though that
some of the global settings

92
00:03:52.02 --> 00:03:54.00
aren't available here.

93
00:03:54.00 --> 00:03:57.04
If you need those, that's
currently a missing feature

94
00:03:57.04 --> 00:03:59.02
and you'll need to jump on over

95
00:03:59.02 --> 00:04:01.02
back to the classic view where you can

96
00:04:01.02 --> 00:04:03.03
see all of those settings and make those

97
00:04:03.03 --> 00:04:05.06
adjustments from the Community tab.

98
00:04:05.06 --> 00:04:08.00
But if you find it easier to actually view

99
00:04:08.00 --> 00:04:09.09
your comments and interact with them,

100
00:04:09.09 --> 00:04:11.06
I do think the new users interface

101
00:04:11.06 --> 00:04:14.03
is a bit more friendly, you can do that.

102
00:04:14.03 --> 00:04:15.09
But for those greater controls

103
00:04:15.09 --> 00:04:17.08
under Community settings, you will

104
00:04:17.08 --> 00:04:20.06
need to return to the
classic user interface.
