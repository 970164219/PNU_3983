1
00:00:00.06 --> 00:00:02.07
- YouTube does offer
several different ways

2
00:00:02.07 --> 00:00:04.04
to interact with the community.

3
00:00:04.04 --> 00:00:06.06
And one of the challenges I find

4
00:00:06.06 --> 00:00:09.06
is keeping up with the many
different ways that people

5
00:00:09.06 --> 00:00:13.03
can engage with your
content or leave a comment.

6
00:00:13.03 --> 00:00:15.06
Some of the things to pay attention to:

7
00:00:15.06 --> 00:00:17.09
Comments are one of the
key ways that people

8
00:00:17.09 --> 00:00:19.06
can leave a reaction.

9
00:00:19.06 --> 00:00:22.05
Do keep in mind that
just like most websites,

10
00:00:22.05 --> 00:00:25.04
the people who comment tend
to be your biggest fans

11
00:00:25.04 --> 00:00:27.06
and your harshest critics.

12
00:00:27.06 --> 00:00:30.00
If you only judge the
performance of your content

13
00:00:30.00 --> 00:00:31.03
on comments.

14
00:00:31.03 --> 00:00:33.07
You're really missing the opportunity.

15
00:00:33.07 --> 00:00:36.02
Because people generally
need to have a lot of passion

16
00:00:36.02 --> 00:00:39.08
to post a comment on a video.

17
00:00:39.08 --> 00:00:42.08
Messages is another way that
they can reach out to you.

18
00:00:42.08 --> 00:00:46.02
It is possible to send a private message.

19
00:00:46.02 --> 00:00:48.03
Now, a lot of times what will happen here

20
00:00:48.03 --> 00:00:50.03
is people want to point out a mistake,

21
00:00:50.03 --> 00:00:52.01
but they want to do it politely

22
00:00:52.01 --> 00:00:55.04
or they want to reach out to
engage with you for business.

23
00:00:55.04 --> 00:00:57.04
Sometimes this is pure spam,

24
00:00:57.04 --> 00:00:59.07
people offering to promote
your YubeTube channel

25
00:00:59.07 --> 00:01:01.05
or do SEO services.

26
00:01:01.05 --> 00:01:05.07
But, other times it is legitimate.

27
00:01:05.07 --> 00:01:07.09
Subscribers are one of
the things you really want

28
00:01:07.09 --> 00:01:09.03
to work to build.

29
00:01:09.03 --> 00:01:11.05
This is where you can see the
people who have subscribed

30
00:01:11.05 --> 00:01:13.01
to your channel.

31
00:01:13.01 --> 00:01:16.06
Now, Super Chat is a unique
feature that's only available

32
00:01:16.06 --> 00:01:18.09
for people in the YouTube partner program

33
00:01:18.09 --> 00:01:20.04
at a certain level.

34
00:01:20.04 --> 00:01:22.01
What this allows you to do,

35
00:01:22.01 --> 00:01:26.02
is that you can have an
engagement method in chat

36
00:01:26.02 --> 00:01:27.04
for live streams.

37
00:01:27.04 --> 00:01:30.07
Where people pay for increased
presence during the chat.

38
00:01:30.07 --> 00:01:33.03
They can actually boost
their comments so it stays

39
00:01:33.03 --> 00:01:35.09
on screen longer, or is featured.

40
00:01:35.09 --> 00:01:39.04
And Credits are a way that
videos that have involved

41
00:01:39.04 --> 00:01:42.00
other people, such as particular talent

42
00:01:42.00 --> 00:01:45.07
or Behind The Scenes crew can
be credited just like a movie.

43
00:01:45.07 --> 00:01:48.07
You need to have enough subscribers
in order to be credited,

44
00:01:48.07 --> 00:01:51.08
but it allows you another
type of connection

45
00:01:51.08 --> 00:01:54.07
if you're participating
in the YouTube community.

46
00:01:54.07 --> 00:01:57.00
Let's take a look at this
in the Control panel.

47
00:01:57.00 --> 00:02:00.09
Over in the Creator's studio,
you'll see the Community tab.

48
00:02:00.09 --> 00:02:04.05
Comments are going to give
you a list of recent comments.

49
00:02:04.05 --> 00:02:08.06
And you can see any comments
that were flagged for review.

50
00:02:08.06 --> 00:02:11.02
This makes it easy if you
want to approve something,

51
00:02:11.02 --> 00:02:18.04
that you can do that.

52
00:02:18.04 --> 00:02:20.07
With a checkbox, it goes live.

53
00:02:20.07 --> 00:02:23.00
If there's a comment
you don't want to share,

54
00:02:23.00 --> 00:02:28.01
just click the trash
button here to remove it.

55
00:02:28.01 --> 00:02:29.06
If there's something you don't like,

56
00:02:29.06 --> 00:02:31.05
you can also report something for spam

57
00:02:31.05 --> 00:02:36.09
or hide any user's comments.

58
00:02:36.09 --> 00:02:40.01
If we go over to messages,
here you can see messages

59
00:02:40.01 --> 00:02:42.03
that people have sent to you.

60
00:02:42.03 --> 00:02:45.01
Usually here, what happens
is, is they're going to reach

61
00:02:45.01 --> 00:02:46.09
out to you about other content.

62
00:02:46.09 --> 00:02:50.03
So for example, I produced
a few content articles

63
00:02:50.03 --> 00:02:52.00
about HDR software.

64
00:02:52.00 --> 00:02:54.00
Here's someone from an
HDR software company

65
00:02:54.00 --> 00:02:58.05
looking to engage me.

66
00:02:58.05 --> 00:03:01.04
You also may see that some of
these are going to be spam,

67
00:03:01.04 --> 00:03:05.09
which is very common
with YouTube messages.

68
00:03:05.09 --> 00:03:08.05
Subscribers lets you see what's happening,

69
00:03:08.05 --> 00:03:11.03
who's engaged, and if you wanna
go back and cross subscribe

70
00:03:11.03 --> 00:03:12.08
to their channel.

71
00:03:12.08 --> 00:03:15.07
Or if you want to send them a message.

72
00:03:15.07 --> 00:03:18.03
Now, there are no tools to send messages

73
00:03:18.03 --> 00:03:20.03
to all of your subscribers,

74
00:03:20.03 --> 00:03:23.05
but if a subscriber comments
and you want to send them

75
00:03:23.05 --> 00:03:26.02
a private message, you can do so.

76
00:03:26.02 --> 00:03:28.06
And you can also visit or engage,

77
00:03:28.06 --> 00:03:32.09
and see who's interacting
with your content.

78
00:03:32.09 --> 00:03:36.07
Super Chat is the functionality
for increased engagement.

79
00:03:36.07 --> 00:03:39.00
And what happens here is you can enable

80
00:03:39.00 --> 00:03:40.08
this on a particular Live Stream,

81
00:03:40.08 --> 00:03:46.02
or take a look at what
people are engaging.

82
00:03:46.02 --> 00:03:48.09
With Super Chat, it is
actually a way of monetizing

83
00:03:48.09 --> 00:03:51.03
your content, uniquely.

84
00:03:51.03 --> 00:03:55.01
Now, for my world, Super Chat's
not gonna be widely used.

85
00:03:55.01 --> 00:03:57.08
But for people using
YouTube to stream gaming

86
00:03:57.08 --> 00:04:00.02
or people that are true, legitimate,

87
00:04:00.02 --> 00:04:01.08
Hollywood-type celebrities,

88
00:04:01.08 --> 00:04:05.04
well, their fans may pay
to actually be prominently

89
00:04:05.04 --> 00:04:09.03
featured and to be more
involved in the content.

90
00:04:09.03 --> 00:04:12.03
For most of you, this isn't
something you're gonna try,

91
00:04:12.03 --> 00:04:15.03
but it is worth dabbling
in to see if it's actually

92
00:04:15.03 --> 00:04:18.02
something that your audience responds to.

93
00:04:18.02 --> 00:04:21.00
Beyond Super Chat, we have
our simple Community settings,

94
00:04:21.00 --> 00:04:22.07
which we've talked about earlier

95
00:04:22.07 --> 00:04:25.01
and the ability for credits.

96
00:04:25.01 --> 00:04:28.00
This is where you can tag
that people are involved,

97
00:04:28.00 --> 00:04:30.00
but in order for this to work,

98
00:04:30.00 --> 00:04:33.00
you do need to have a
premium account with plenty

99
00:04:33.00 --> 00:04:35.05
of views before you can
actually be available

100
00:04:35.05 --> 00:04:38.05
to be credited in a YouTube production.

101
00:04:38.05 --> 00:04:41.03
Now, if you are using the
newer version of YouTube,

102
00:04:41.03 --> 00:04:44.00
it also offers some of these controls.

103
00:04:44.00 --> 00:04:47.01
You'll see here that
you can view comments.

104
00:04:47.01 --> 00:04:50.03
And this is where you
can see what's happening.

105
00:04:50.03 --> 00:04:52.02
Public, Held For Review.

106
00:04:52.02 --> 00:04:54.05
If we click the Filter Dialog box here,

107
00:04:54.05 --> 00:04:56.06
we can actually search for something.

108
00:04:56.06 --> 00:04:58.08
So if I wanna take a look
for people commenting

109
00:04:58.08 --> 00:05:00.09
on a particular tool,

110
00:05:00.09 --> 00:05:03.07
I can type something in like Photoshop.

111
00:05:03.07 --> 00:05:06.03
And now it's searched
through all my videos

112
00:05:06.03 --> 00:05:10.06
for where the word Photoshop
appeared and I can respond.

113
00:05:10.06 --> 00:05:13.09
This makes it easy to
actually find something.

114
00:05:13.09 --> 00:05:17.05
Or maybe you're looking
for a particular person.

115
00:05:17.05 --> 00:05:21.00
However, this really is
the only option you have.

116
00:05:21.00 --> 00:05:23.08
You don't have the ability to
see your entire community here

117
00:05:23.08 --> 00:05:27.04
from the new view at this time.

118
00:05:27.04 --> 00:05:31.00
So, while this is useful
and a great way to review

119
00:05:31.00 --> 00:05:32.04
and look at comments,

120
00:05:32.04 --> 00:05:35.05
it's still being built out
and a lot of the functionality

121
00:05:35.05 --> 00:05:36.05
you're going to desire

122
00:05:36.05 --> 00:05:40.01
is going to be over in YouTube Classic.

123
00:05:40.01 --> 00:05:42.01
So in this case, you might need to click

124
00:05:42.01 --> 00:05:46.04
Creator Studio Classic and switch on over.

125
00:05:46.04 --> 00:05:49.01
And this will let you see
all of those other views

126
00:05:49.01 --> 00:05:50.04
for Community.
