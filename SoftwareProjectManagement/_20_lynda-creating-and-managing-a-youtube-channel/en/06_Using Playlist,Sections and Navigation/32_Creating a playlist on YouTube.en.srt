00:00:00.05 --> 00:00:03.03
- One of the most useful ways
to manage content on YouTube

2
00:00:03.03 --> 00:00:04.07
is with a playlist.

3
00:00:04.07 --> 00:00:08.04
A playlist is simply a list of
videos that people can play,

4
00:00:08.04 --> 00:00:10.00
but it's a little bit more than that.

5
00:00:10.00 --> 00:00:12.05
With a playlist, you
have some great controls.

6
00:00:12.05 --> 00:00:14.08
For example, you could put
together a collection of videos

7
00:00:14.08 --> 00:00:16.07
that you've created

8
00:00:16.07 --> 00:00:19.05
or you can use a playlist to
group videos that you've made

9
00:00:19.05 --> 00:00:23.03
in a large library by topic or type.

10
00:00:23.03 --> 00:00:26.04
Playlists can also be
embedded into a single player,

11
00:00:26.04 --> 00:00:27.09
meaning that on your website,

12
00:00:27.09 --> 00:00:29.09
you could put a collection of videos

13
00:00:29.09 --> 00:00:32.02
or allow someone who's browsing YouTube

14
00:00:32.02 --> 00:00:33.07
to easily find a playlist

15
00:00:33.07 --> 00:00:36.02
and watch multiple things from you.

16
00:00:36.02 --> 00:00:39.01
Playlists can also contain
videos by other folks

17
00:00:39.01 --> 00:00:40.06
and this is one of the greatest ways

18
00:00:40.06 --> 00:00:43.00
of helping people discover content.

19
00:00:43.00 --> 00:00:46.03
Think of it as curation.

20
00:00:46.03 --> 00:00:48.07
To create a playlist is pretty simple.

21
00:00:48.07 --> 00:00:49.09
There are several places

22
00:00:49.09 --> 00:00:53.00
where the create playlist
function is listed.

23
00:00:53.00 --> 00:00:54.07
You can create a playlist a few ways,

24
00:00:54.07 --> 00:00:58.06
for example by clicking on
playlist in the left-hand column.

25
00:00:58.06 --> 00:01:00.06
This is currently only available

26
00:01:00.06 --> 00:01:04.07
in the primary YouTube Studio.

27
00:01:04.07 --> 00:01:08.06
You could also click new playlist.

28
00:01:08.06 --> 00:01:10.07
As you see here, there's playlists

29
00:01:10.07 --> 00:01:16.01
and this gives you the option
to easily create new ones.

30
00:01:16.01 --> 00:01:18.02
Now once you've created a playlist,

31
00:01:18.02 --> 00:01:21.07
you're going to enter a descriptive title,

32
00:01:21.07 --> 00:01:25.05
add a general description
about the playlist,

33
00:01:25.05 --> 00:01:28.01
and add multiple videos to it.

34
00:01:28.01 --> 00:01:30.09
Now that you understand the
general concepts of a playlist,

35
00:01:30.09 --> 00:01:31.09
let's build one.

36
00:01:31.09 --> 00:01:35.00
To view playlists, simply
access your channel

37
00:01:35.00 --> 00:01:39.09
and then go to the Creator Studio.

38
00:01:39.09 --> 00:01:42.04
You'll see playlists
in the left-hand column

39
00:01:42.04 --> 00:01:43.09
under the video manager.

40
00:01:43.09 --> 00:01:46.03
If you're using a newer
version of the YouTube Studio,

41
00:01:46.03 --> 00:01:49.01
you'll notice that
playlists may be missing

42
00:01:49.01 --> 00:01:53.03
and clicking will redirect you
to the old version of Studio.

43
00:01:53.03 --> 00:01:56.04
Let's take a look at a sample playlist.

44
00:01:56.04 --> 00:01:58.07
Here are some that I've already created,

45
00:01:58.07 --> 00:02:02.04
but I'm going to click the
button here for new playlist.

46
00:02:02.04 --> 00:02:03.06
We'll give it a name

47
00:02:03.06 --> 00:02:08.00
and currently set this to
unlisted as I refine it.

48
00:02:08.00 --> 00:02:10.01
Later on, I can move this to public

49
00:02:10.01 --> 00:02:12.03
and this is just like other videos.

50
00:02:12.03 --> 00:02:17.01
A playlist can be public,
unlisted, or private.

51
00:02:17.01 --> 00:02:19.02
Let's click create.

52
00:02:19.02 --> 00:02:22.05
Now you'll see that it
just needs videos added.

53
00:02:22.05 --> 00:02:24.02
One of the easiest ways to do this

54
00:02:24.02 --> 00:02:25.09
is to click the edit button.

55
00:02:25.09 --> 00:02:28.09
Now what we can do is start to add videos

56
00:02:28.09 --> 00:02:32.07
so I'll click add videos
and it brings up a dialogue.

57
00:02:32.07 --> 00:02:36.06
You'll note that you can
search by specific URLs,

58
00:02:36.06 --> 00:02:40.08
search with general videos,
or your YouTube videos.

59
00:02:40.08 --> 00:02:43.03
Since I want to make a
playlist of my content,

60
00:02:43.03 --> 00:02:46.06
I'll click on your YouTube videos

61
00:02:46.06 --> 00:02:49.02
and it allows me to see
what's happening here.

62
00:02:49.02 --> 00:02:51.06
Now I can scroll through my content

63
00:02:51.06 --> 00:03:00.01
and look for particular things
that I would like to add.

64
00:03:00.01 --> 00:03:02.05
I can in fact hold down the Command key

65
00:03:02.05 --> 00:03:04.05
or the Control key on a PC

66
00:03:04.05 --> 00:03:08.06
and start to select multiple videos.

67
00:03:08.06 --> 00:03:14.02
When I click add videos, they
are placed into the playlist.

68
00:03:14.02 --> 00:03:16.03
If you want to change
the order of the videos,

69
00:03:16.03 --> 00:03:18.01
you can simply click and drag

70
00:03:18.01 --> 00:03:22.06
to move them to a new stacking order.

71
00:03:22.06 --> 00:03:26.04
For advanced options, click
the playlist settings.

72
00:03:26.04 --> 00:03:29.05
This allows you to control
additional properties.

73
00:03:29.05 --> 00:03:32.01
You'll notice for example
that you can control

74
00:03:32.01 --> 00:03:34.08
public versus unlisted versus private,

75
00:03:34.08 --> 00:03:38.03
private being just like
videos that are invite only.

76
00:03:38.03 --> 00:03:42.04
You have the ability to sort
manually like I did here

77
00:03:42.04 --> 00:03:46.08
or to sort based upon date
added, date published,

78
00:03:46.08 --> 00:03:50.00
or which ones are most popular.

79
00:03:50.00 --> 00:03:51.04
And if this is something

80
00:03:51.04 --> 00:03:54.00
that's tied to an ongoing web series,

81
00:03:54.00 --> 00:03:57.06
you can go ahead and market
as the official series.

82
00:03:57.06 --> 00:03:59.01
Now let's leave this as is

83
00:03:59.01 --> 00:04:01.07
and we'll talk about more
of the options in a moment.
