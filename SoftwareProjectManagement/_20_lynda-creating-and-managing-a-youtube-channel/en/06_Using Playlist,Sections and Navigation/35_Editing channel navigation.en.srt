1
00:00:00.05 --> 00:00:02.00
- Now if you go to edit
your page and you can't

2
00:00:02.00 --> 00:00:04.06
easily find the options
to do so, you might have

3
00:00:04.06 --> 00:00:07.03
disabled the ability to
customize your channel.

4
00:00:07.03 --> 00:00:08.08
Let me show you where this is.

5
00:00:08.08 --> 00:00:10.02
If you want to take advantage of editing

6
00:00:10.02 --> 00:00:12.08
the navigation, make sure
you sign into your account

7
00:00:12.08 --> 00:00:14.05
and visit the channel.

8
00:00:14.05 --> 00:00:17.00
You can then click the edit layout button.

9
00:00:17.00 --> 00:00:19.07
Then choose the settings
icon and make sure

10
00:00:19.07 --> 00:00:21.04
that customize is on.

11
00:00:21.04 --> 00:00:22.04
Pretty simple.

12
00:00:22.04 --> 00:00:24.02
You click the settings icon there

13
00:00:24.02 --> 00:00:27.02
and in the pop-up list
make sure that customize

14
00:00:27.02 --> 00:00:28.05
is enabled.

15
00:00:28.05 --> 00:00:30.04
Here we are back on
Photofocus and I'll click

16
00:00:30.04 --> 00:00:32.08
the settings button.

17
00:00:32.08 --> 00:00:35.02
You'll notice that customize
the layout of the channel

18
00:00:35.02 --> 00:00:37.01
is turned on.

19
00:00:37.01 --> 00:00:40.01
If you don't have this
turned on and you disable it,

20
00:00:40.01 --> 00:00:43.02
what'll happen is it
goes to default layout.

21
00:00:43.02 --> 00:00:45.06
However, I'm going to leave that enabled

22
00:00:45.06 --> 00:00:48.02
but if for some reason
you're unable to add sections

23
00:00:48.02 --> 00:00:50.06
or rearrange items on the page, make sure

24
00:00:50.06 --> 00:00:52.05
you enable this option.

25
00:00:52.05 --> 00:00:54.03
Additionally, feel free to click over

26
00:00:54.03 --> 00:00:56.00
to advanced settings.

27
00:00:56.00 --> 00:00:58.06
This will give you additional
controls over what's happening

28
00:00:58.06 --> 00:01:01.06
on the page for example,
if you want to allow ads

29
00:01:01.06 --> 00:01:05.02
to appear on the page, if
there's an associated website,

30
00:01:05.02 --> 00:01:07.09
and if you want your content to be shown

31
00:01:07.09 --> 00:01:10.05
on other channel recommendations.

32
00:01:10.05 --> 00:01:13.01
By allowing your content
to appear on other channels

33
00:01:13.01 --> 00:01:16.01
as a recommended channel,
this means that other channels

34
00:01:16.01 --> 00:01:18.02
will appear on your page.

35
00:01:18.02 --> 00:01:20.02
Additionally you can
choose if you want to show

36
00:01:20.02 --> 00:01:23.03
the subscriber count or not
and if you want to track

37
00:01:23.03 --> 00:01:25.00
with Google Analytics.

38
00:01:25.00 --> 00:01:27.04
What you'll notice for example
if we visit the channel

39
00:01:27.04 --> 00:01:30.05
is there are some of those
featured promotion channels.

40
00:01:30.05 --> 00:01:32.09
These are channels that
are similar to mine

41
00:01:32.09 --> 00:01:35.00
and they appear in my sidebar.

42
00:01:35.00 --> 00:01:37.01
There's a good chance
that my channel may be

43
00:01:37.01 --> 00:01:39.01
promoted on theirs or on other websites

44
00:01:39.01 --> 00:01:40.08
that are similar.

45
00:01:40.08 --> 00:01:43.09
Additionally I turned off the
option to show subscribers

46
00:01:43.09 --> 00:01:45.08
so that doesn't appear on the channel page

47
00:01:45.08 --> 00:01:50.00
but you do have that option
of making it visible or not.

48
00:01:50.00 --> 00:01:53.02
Taking the time to customize
your channel is essential.

49
00:01:53.02 --> 00:01:56.00
Don't go through all of this
work of uploading videos,

50
00:01:56.00 --> 00:01:58.00
organizing them and
putting a graphic identity

51
00:01:58.00 --> 00:02:00.09
just to let YouTube automatically generate

52
00:02:00.09 --> 00:02:02.05
your channel navigation.

53
00:02:02.05 --> 00:02:04.08
You should decide what's
strategically important

54
00:02:04.08 --> 00:02:07.08
and what content you want
to feature and what videos

55
00:02:07.08 --> 00:02:10.05
are going to have the best
results to drive subscribers

56
00:02:10.05 --> 00:02:11.09
and viewers.
