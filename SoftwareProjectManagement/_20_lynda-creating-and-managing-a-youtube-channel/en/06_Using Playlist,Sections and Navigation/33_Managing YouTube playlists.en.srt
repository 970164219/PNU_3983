00:00:00.05 --> 00:00:01.07
- [Instructor] Once you've
built some playlists,

2
00:00:01.07 --> 00:00:03.08
there are some great
options you have to control

3
00:00:03.08 --> 00:00:05.05
how it actually works.

4
00:00:05.05 --> 00:00:06.09
Let's talk about that.

5
00:00:06.09 --> 00:00:08.05
When it comes managing your playlists,

6
00:00:08.05 --> 00:00:12.03
you have the ability to re-order videos,

7
00:00:12.03 --> 00:00:15.01
change their general settings,

8
00:00:15.01 --> 00:00:17.05
and use options like auto add.

9
00:00:17.05 --> 00:00:20.04
This is easiest explained by taking a look

10
00:00:20.04 --> 00:00:22.02
at an existing playlist.

11
00:00:22.02 --> 00:00:24.04
So either take one that
you created yourself

12
00:00:24.04 --> 00:00:26.08
or just follow along.

13
00:00:26.08 --> 00:00:29.08
When you're working with the playlist,

14
00:00:29.08 --> 00:00:31.04
remember you have the ability to click

15
00:00:31.04 --> 00:00:35.02
on playlist settings
to access the controls.

16
00:00:35.02 --> 00:00:37.05
This is where you can
change things like the order

17
00:00:37.05 --> 00:00:39.07
and the privacy settings
we discussed earlier.

18
00:00:39.07 --> 00:00:42.09
You also can take advantage of auto add.

19
00:00:42.09 --> 00:00:44.08
This means that you can create a rule.

20
00:00:44.08 --> 00:00:47.05
For example, I can say add any videos

21
00:00:47.05 --> 00:00:56.04
that contain the word luminar
to this luminar playlist.

22
00:00:56.04 --> 00:00:59.01
And I can also add an additional rule,

23
00:00:59.01 --> 00:01:00.06
and you see that we can work with things

24
00:01:00.06 --> 00:01:03.08
that are tagged with luminar.

25
00:01:03.08 --> 00:01:07.02
That way, whether the title
or the tag says luminar,

26
00:01:07.02 --> 00:01:09.07
it's automatically added.

27
00:01:09.07 --> 00:01:11.08
I also have the ability to collaborate.

28
00:01:11.08 --> 00:01:15.01
So I can turn this on and
that means that I can invite

29
00:01:15.01 --> 00:01:19.02
specific collaborators to
actually work with this.

30
00:01:19.02 --> 00:01:21.09
So if I get this particular
link and send it to em,

31
00:01:21.09 --> 00:01:25.02
what this means is is that
if I have other people

32
00:01:25.02 --> 00:01:28.04
within my organization
or trusted colleagues

33
00:01:28.04 --> 00:01:30.07
that I want to invite,
they have the ability

34
00:01:30.07 --> 00:01:35.01
to also add their videos to the playlist.

35
00:01:35.01 --> 00:01:37.03
This is independent of
people who have access

36
00:01:37.03 --> 00:01:38.04
to your channel.

37
00:01:38.04 --> 00:01:41.01
If you've invited managers or
collaborators to the channel,

38
00:01:41.01 --> 00:01:43.06
they can of course access the playlist

39
00:01:43.06 --> 00:01:45.02
through the brand account.

40
00:01:45.02 --> 00:01:47.05
But this is ideal if you want to work

41
00:01:47.05 --> 00:01:49.06
with outside contributors who are not

42
00:01:49.06 --> 00:01:51.03
managing your channel.

43
00:01:51.03 --> 00:01:54.01
This gives them management
ability to add videos

44
00:01:54.01 --> 00:01:58.02
to a playlist that's meant to
be shared with the community.

45
00:01:58.02 --> 00:02:00.02
When you click save, it will go ahead

46
00:02:00.02 --> 00:02:05.06
and capture these
settings for the playlist.

47
00:02:05.06 --> 00:02:07.07
I'll go ahead and do this.

48
00:02:07.07 --> 00:02:08.08
It says there's another video that

49
00:02:08.08 --> 00:02:13.04
has the word luminar in
it, so I'll click done.

50
00:02:13.04 --> 00:02:18.03
And you see now that it put
another video into the playlist.

51
00:02:18.03 --> 00:02:20.02
Now if I decide that I don't want that,

52
00:02:20.02 --> 00:02:22.06
from the more menu here,
you'll see that I can actually

53
00:02:22.06 --> 00:02:25.03
move things around, or I can change things

54
00:02:25.03 --> 00:02:29.04
like the thumbnails, or move
it to the top or bottom.

55
00:02:29.04 --> 00:02:30.08
This works quite well.

56
00:02:30.08 --> 00:02:33.09
If you decide you also
want to add videos again,

57
00:02:33.09 --> 00:02:36.03
just click the add videos button.

58
00:02:36.03 --> 00:02:38.04
But now, this is ready to share,

59
00:02:38.04 --> 00:02:47.04
and the only thing missing
is the description.

60
00:02:47.04 --> 00:02:50.02
And in this case I'm just
adding a simple description,

61
00:02:50.02 --> 00:02:53.03
much like I would describe
an individual video.

62
00:02:53.03 --> 00:02:56.01
But including that this is
a collection or a playlist

63
00:02:56.01 --> 00:02:59.02
is a good idea, and this gives
me a simple pop-up control

64
00:02:59.02 --> 00:03:02.06
where I can share this
or embed it on a website

65
00:03:02.06 --> 00:03:04.07
or easily email it to folks.

66
00:03:04.07 --> 00:03:07.00
So this is quite useful.

67
00:03:07.00 --> 00:03:09.06
Your ability to control
playlists is a great way

68
00:03:09.06 --> 00:03:13.00
to organize your content
and easily invite others

69
00:03:13.00 --> 00:03:15.04
to experience it and enjoy it.
