1
00:00:00.05 --> 00:00:03.03
- Besides creating playlists
to organize your content,

2
00:00:03.03 --> 00:00:05.04
you can take advantage of sections.

3
00:00:05.04 --> 00:00:07.08
Sections are parts of your channel

4
00:00:07.08 --> 00:00:10.01
that are dedicated to a particular video

5
00:00:10.01 --> 00:00:11.06
or series of videos.

6
00:00:11.06 --> 00:00:15.01
And oftentimes, playlists
will become a section.

7
00:00:15.01 --> 00:00:17.02
Now using sections is an easy way

8
00:00:17.02 --> 00:00:19.06
because you can take
this as a simple method

9
00:00:19.06 --> 00:00:22.00
to organize the content and promote it,

10
00:00:22.00 --> 00:00:24.06
giving visual weight to it on the page.

11
00:00:24.06 --> 00:00:27.04
You can create a section
from a single playlist.

12
00:00:27.04 --> 00:00:29.09
You can use multiple playlists

13
00:00:29.09 --> 00:00:31.08
or even a group of other channels

14
00:00:31.08 --> 00:00:33.00
that you'd like to recommend

15
00:00:33.00 --> 00:00:34.07
or if you have additional brand accounts

16
00:00:34.07 --> 00:00:39.03
that are associated with your company.

17
00:00:39.03 --> 00:00:41.02
Some good examples of using sections

18
00:00:41.02 --> 00:00:43.03
include grouping things by topic

19
00:00:43.03 --> 00:00:46.00
or perhaps a family of products

20
00:00:46.00 --> 00:00:48.05
or maybe a promotion that you're running

21
00:00:48.05 --> 00:00:51.08
or perhaps it's videos
that feature the same host.

22
00:00:51.08 --> 00:00:55.09
You could have a total of
10 sections on your channel.

23
00:00:55.09 --> 00:00:59.06
And as you see here, this is
an example of Adorama's channel

24
00:00:59.06 --> 00:01:01.04
and they've organized their videos

25
00:01:01.04 --> 00:01:05.09
based upon different types of
items such as product reviews

26
00:01:05.09 --> 00:01:09.00
or perhaps an individual host or author.

27
00:01:09.00 --> 00:01:12.05
Here's another example of a
series on the Photo Focus site

28
00:01:12.05 --> 00:01:14.02
where we've taken particular videos

29
00:01:14.02 --> 00:01:17.00
such as the story behind a photo.

30
00:01:17.00 --> 00:01:18.09
All right, how does this work?

31
00:01:18.09 --> 00:01:25.01
When you're logged in,
simply visit My Channel

32
00:01:25.01 --> 00:01:31.08
and you can click on Customize Channel.

33
00:01:31.08 --> 00:01:36.02
Now you'll see different sections.

34
00:01:36.02 --> 00:01:40.07
So for example if I want
to prioritize something,

35
00:01:40.07 --> 00:01:43.02
I can select it here and just click

36
00:01:43.02 --> 00:01:46.05
to continue to move it up in the stack.

37
00:01:46.05 --> 00:01:50.00
That's for an existing playlist.

38
00:01:50.00 --> 00:01:53.01
If I decide to, I can also
click the edit button here

39
00:01:53.01 --> 00:01:56.08
and you see I can control what's
happening in that section.

40
00:01:56.08 --> 00:02:00.07
For example, I'm using a single playlist

41
00:02:00.07 --> 00:02:04.05
and I can change the style
of how that's presented.

42
00:02:04.05 --> 00:02:08.06
There's a vertical list which
features the descriptions more

43
00:02:08.06 --> 00:02:12.07
or a horizontal row
with just the thumbnails

44
00:02:12.07 --> 00:02:15.03
and you choose if you want
to use one of your playlists

45
00:02:15.03 --> 00:02:18.07
or the URL of somebody
else's shared playlist.

46
00:02:18.07 --> 00:02:21.06
When you click done, it updates.

47
00:02:21.06 --> 00:02:23.09
Now if you decide to add another section,

48
00:02:23.09 --> 00:02:26.07
you'll notice that you have
that ability at the very bottom,

49
00:02:26.07 --> 00:02:28.05
add a section.

50
00:02:28.05 --> 00:02:29.09
Clicking this gives you the option

51
00:02:29.09 --> 00:02:32.00
to choose what to feature.

52
00:02:32.00 --> 00:02:33.06
For example, I can say

53
00:02:33.06 --> 00:02:39.00
I want to feature my most popular uploads.

54
00:02:39.00 --> 00:02:42.03
And that's going to easily add that

55
00:02:42.03 --> 00:02:45.02
and I'll click save or done

56
00:02:45.02 --> 00:02:47.03
and you see that that's
my most popular videos.

57
00:02:47.03 --> 00:02:50.05
In fact, that's probably a
good thing to put at the top

58
00:02:50.05 --> 00:02:58.02
so let's move that all the
way to the top of the stack.

59
00:02:58.02 --> 00:02:59.08
This is a very easy way

60
00:02:59.08 --> 00:03:02.08
to put your most popular content first.

61
00:03:02.08 --> 00:03:04.09
Now you'll notice here that all sections

62
00:03:04.09 --> 00:03:08.02
have the ability to
control what's being shown.

63
00:03:08.02 --> 00:03:10.02
For example here with the feature content,

64
00:03:10.02 --> 00:03:13.01
I've chosen to show the latest upload

65
00:03:13.01 --> 00:03:15.01
or I can show the latest activity,

66
00:03:15.01 --> 00:03:17.02
videos that have comments on them.

67
00:03:17.02 --> 00:03:19.03
For example, I recently made this playlist

68
00:03:19.03 --> 00:03:21.05
and I'm going to call that out.

69
00:03:21.05 --> 00:03:23.01
You'll notice that new visitors

70
00:03:23.01 --> 00:03:25.02
are going to see a trailer by default.

71
00:03:25.02 --> 00:03:28.00
You just need to assign it and
we talked about that earlier

72
00:03:28.00 --> 00:03:31.04
while returning subscribers
will see recent content

73
00:03:31.04 --> 00:03:34.07
or featured content towards the top.

74
00:03:34.07 --> 00:03:37.03
All right, this works pretty
well and as you can tell,

75
00:03:37.03 --> 00:03:39.07
taking the time to add additional sections

76
00:03:39.07 --> 00:03:43.01
really makes it easy to call
out the content on your page.
