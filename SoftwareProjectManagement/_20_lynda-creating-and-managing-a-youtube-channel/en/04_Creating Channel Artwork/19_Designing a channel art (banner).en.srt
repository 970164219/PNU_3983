1
00:00:00.03 --> 00:00:03.08
- Designing a banner for
your channel is quite tricky.

2
00:00:03.08 --> 00:00:07.03
That's because YouTube serves
up three different sizes

3
00:00:07.03 --> 00:00:10.01
depending upon what platform you're using,

4
00:00:10.01 --> 00:00:14.08
desktop computer, mobile
device, and a television.

5
00:00:14.08 --> 00:00:18.06
Remember, a lot of TVs have
access to YouTube channels.

6
00:00:18.06 --> 00:00:20.04
Internet connected TVs have become

7
00:00:20.04 --> 00:00:24.00
a big part of people's homes
and instead of watching cable,

8
00:00:24.00 --> 00:00:26.02
a lot of folks simply browse to YouTube

9
00:00:26.02 --> 00:00:28.09
and find channels that
they're interested in.

10
00:00:28.09 --> 00:00:31.04
Well, in any case, all of
these different platforms

11
00:00:31.04 --> 00:00:33.01
can also serve up variance

12
00:00:33.01 --> 00:00:36.00
because the phones have
different size screens.

13
00:00:36.00 --> 00:00:37.04
As do the tablets.

14
00:00:37.04 --> 00:00:39.06
And sometimes the resolution may change

15
00:00:39.06 --> 00:00:41.09
based upon user settings.

16
00:00:41.09 --> 00:00:44.02
As such, it gets pretty tricky.

17
00:00:44.02 --> 00:00:46.02
But here are a few guidelines.

18
00:00:46.02 --> 00:00:48.09
When it comes to making
channel art or a banner,

19
00:00:48.09 --> 00:00:50.03
I always go with a template.

20
00:00:50.03 --> 00:00:52.02
And I'll show you that in a moment.

21
00:00:52.02 --> 00:00:57.04
But the minimum dimensions
are 2048 x 1152.

22
00:00:57.04 --> 00:00:59.08
So if the image is lower than this,

23
00:00:59.08 --> 00:01:03.08
it cannot be uploaded as artwork.

24
00:01:03.08 --> 00:01:11.00
Make sure that the safe area
for the text is 1546 x 423.

25
00:01:11.00 --> 00:01:14.04
This is a smaller component,
meaning that anything

26
00:01:14.04 --> 00:01:17.03
that has text or logos
that you want to be read

27
00:01:17.03 --> 00:01:23.00
has to be shrunk down
and placed in the center.

28
00:01:23.00 --> 00:01:25.09
If an image is larger, then chances are

29
00:01:25.09 --> 00:01:32.03
YouTube will crop away
some of the information.

30
00:01:32.03 --> 00:01:40.01
The maximum width that you can
upload is 2560 pixels by 423.

31
00:01:40.01 --> 00:01:42.09
This can get a little tricky.

32
00:01:42.09 --> 00:01:48.01
If you upload larger, it's
going to crop it and resize.

33
00:01:48.01 --> 00:01:51.05
What this really means here
is that the middle area

34
00:01:51.05 --> 00:01:53.05
is always going to be visible.

35
00:01:53.05 --> 00:01:55.05
So if you are going to build something

36
00:01:55.05 --> 00:02:00.03
and you want it to be
skinny, this is the size.

37
00:02:00.03 --> 00:02:02.04
Now, depending upon the device,

38
00:02:02.04 --> 00:02:07.07
those areas might get cropped
or padded with a color.

39
00:02:07.07 --> 00:02:10.01
The file also must be smaller

40
00:02:10.01 --> 00:02:13.01
than six megabytes in order to upload.

41
00:02:13.01 --> 00:02:17.04
Which shouldn't be a
problem if you save a JPEG.

42
00:02:17.04 --> 00:02:19.09
There is a template file available.

43
00:02:19.09 --> 00:02:22.08
And here's the direct link
to the support article.

44
00:02:22.08 --> 00:02:26.03
But if you just do a search
on the YouTube help page

45
00:02:26.03 --> 00:02:30.02
for channel art template,
you'll find this.

46
00:02:30.02 --> 00:02:34.08
And in fact, a link is built
into the uploader as well.

47
00:02:34.08 --> 00:02:36.07
You want to use this template.

48
00:02:36.07 --> 00:02:39.00
It's available both as a PNG file,

49
00:02:39.00 --> 00:02:40.08
if you're using other tools,

50
00:02:40.08 --> 00:02:45.02
or a Photoshop template,
making it a lot easier.

51
00:02:45.02 --> 00:02:47.09
This helps you understand
the different devices,

52
00:02:47.09 --> 00:02:52.00
such as television, desktop, and tablet.

53
00:02:52.00 --> 00:02:54.04
These devices will vary depending upon

54
00:02:54.04 --> 00:02:58.01
the width of the screen
and what people are using.

55
00:02:58.01 --> 00:03:01.00
Here's the image that I
was working with earlier.

56
00:03:01.00 --> 00:03:04.02
And you see, if I turn on the PSD overlay,

57
00:03:04.02 --> 00:03:07.09
there's actually a folder here
with all of those guidelines,

58
00:03:07.09 --> 00:03:11.05
making it easier to see the content.

59
00:03:11.05 --> 00:03:13.08
Let me turn off the
background photo for a moment

60
00:03:13.08 --> 00:03:17.09
and you can see that I've
trapped the logo in the center.

61
00:03:17.09 --> 00:03:20.02
Now I decided to nudge that to the side

62
00:03:20.02 --> 00:03:22.08
because sometimes YouTube
puts other information

63
00:03:22.08 --> 00:03:24.02
here on the right.

64
00:03:24.02 --> 00:03:28.01
But if you wanted to center
that, you can do that as well.

65
00:03:28.01 --> 00:03:31.04
Just select the item
and the background layer

66
00:03:31.04 --> 00:03:34.02
and using a tool like the move tool,

67
00:03:34.02 --> 00:03:37.07
you'll see options for alignment.

68
00:03:37.07 --> 00:03:41.03
Now let's build this.

69
00:03:41.03 --> 00:03:43.08
If you take a look at
the folder, I've included

70
00:03:43.08 --> 00:03:47.08
a download copy of that official
YouTube channel template.

71
00:03:47.08 --> 00:03:52.02
Just double-click to open it.

72
00:03:52.02 --> 00:03:56.08
You may need to update the fonts.

73
00:03:56.08 --> 00:03:58.08
Then, select your background layer

74
00:03:58.08 --> 00:04:04.05
by choosing file, place embedded.

75
00:04:04.05 --> 00:04:08.04
Navigate to the artwork
that you want to use.

76
00:04:08.04 --> 00:04:11.02
I've put it in this sources folder here.

77
00:04:11.02 --> 00:04:15.00
And I can choose this banner.

78
00:04:15.00 --> 00:04:18.00
Now, I just need to adjust the size.

79
00:04:18.00 --> 00:04:21.06
Holding down shift and
option, I can constrain it

80
00:04:21.06 --> 00:04:25.06
so it scales up from the middle.

81
00:04:25.06 --> 00:04:28.08
And then press return.

82
00:04:28.08 --> 00:04:32.03
Then choose file, place embedded,

83
00:04:32.03 --> 00:04:37.04
and navigate to the logo
that you want to use

84
00:04:37.04 --> 00:04:40.05
and click place.

85
00:04:40.05 --> 00:04:43.09
You can now adjust the size.

86
00:04:43.09 --> 00:04:49.05
Holding down shift and option
to make it easier to place it.

87
00:04:49.05 --> 00:04:55.00
Now, so that was more readable,
I chose to add an overlay.

88
00:04:55.00 --> 00:04:59.01
I simply chose a Photoshop
color overlay style

89
00:04:59.01 --> 00:05:03.05
and layered on white at 100% opacity,

90
00:05:03.05 --> 00:05:07.08
making the logo cut a bit
better against the backdrop.

91
00:05:07.08 --> 00:05:12.06
Before you save this off,
turn off the overlay layer

92
00:05:12.06 --> 00:05:16.00
that shows you the template guidelines.

93
00:05:16.00 --> 00:05:20.01
Now, you can simply say file,

94
00:05:20.01 --> 00:05:22.06
export,

95
00:05:22.06 --> 00:05:24.09
save for web.

96
00:05:24.09 --> 00:05:28.02
Save off a high or medium quality JPEG

97
00:05:28.02 --> 00:05:31.07
and it's ready for upload to YouTube.

98
00:05:31.07 --> 00:05:34.09
I'll just set this to JPEG high

99
00:05:34.09 --> 00:05:37.08
and click save

100
00:05:37.08 --> 00:05:44.05
and let's call this channel art

101
00:05:44.05 --> 00:05:45.09
pdp

102
00:05:45.09 --> 00:05:48.04
2.

103
00:05:48.04 --> 00:05:51.03
And I'll save this into folder 4.0,

104
00:05:51.03 --> 00:05:53.09
where I'm working currently

105
00:05:53.09 --> 00:05:55.01
and click save.

106
00:05:55.01 --> 00:05:57.03
Now if I switch back to YouTube

107
00:05:57.03 --> 00:06:00.05
and make sure I'm logged
into the correct channel.

108
00:06:00.05 --> 00:06:08.02
Let's go ahead and switch here.

109
00:06:08.02 --> 00:06:14.09
I can now choose to view my channel,

110
00:06:14.09 --> 00:06:19.02
and I'll simply click
the photo button here.

111
00:06:19.02 --> 00:06:24.02
And I can select a new image.

112
00:06:24.02 --> 00:06:28.02
Let's go to folder 4.0

113
00:06:28.02 --> 00:06:33.02
and I'll choose that
new image that I created

114
00:06:33.02 --> 00:06:35.08
and click choose.

115
00:06:35.08 --> 00:06:37.02
It uploads.

116
00:06:37.02 --> 00:06:39.05
And I get a preview of
how it's going to look

117
00:06:39.05 --> 00:06:42.05
on my different devices.

118
00:06:42.05 --> 00:06:46.02
When satisfied, I'll click select.

119
00:06:46.02 --> 00:06:48.02
Now if you don't build a template out

120
00:06:48.02 --> 00:06:49.08
and you're just uploading a photo,

121
00:06:49.08 --> 00:06:52.08
you might take advantage
of the auto-enhance feature

122
00:06:52.08 --> 00:06:54.04
which will attempt to automatically

123
00:06:54.04 --> 00:06:56.06
boost color and contrast.

124
00:06:56.06 --> 00:06:59.01
But if you've built this
yourself and you used

125
00:06:59.01 --> 00:07:02.06
a graphics editing tool,
you're probably okay as is.

126
00:07:02.06 --> 00:07:05.01
So I'll just click select

127
00:07:05.01 --> 00:07:07.04
and it updates and adds that in.

128
00:07:07.04 --> 00:07:10.08
So you see that the page now
takes on the new branding.
