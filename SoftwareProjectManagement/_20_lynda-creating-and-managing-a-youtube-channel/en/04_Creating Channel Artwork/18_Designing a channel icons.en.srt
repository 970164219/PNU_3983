00:00:00.06 --> 00:00:01.04
- [Instructor] Let's start with

2
00:00:01.04 --> 00:00:03.03
one of the most important
pieces of artwork

3
00:00:03.03 --> 00:00:05.03
that you're going to
need for your channel,

4
00:00:05.03 --> 00:00:09.08
and that is the icon for your
brand or you as an individual.

5
00:00:09.08 --> 00:00:13.08
Now getting an icon that works
at a small size is important.

6
00:00:13.08 --> 00:00:15.07
Let's go over the specs
and then I'll show you some

7
00:00:15.07 --> 00:00:18.09
design strategies using a
tool like Adobe Photoshop.

8
00:00:18.09 --> 00:00:21.04
With your channel icon, make
sure you choose an image

9
00:00:21.04 --> 00:00:25.05
that's going to be recognizable
and work at a small size.

10
00:00:25.05 --> 00:00:28.04
You don't want too much detail.

11
00:00:28.04 --> 00:00:31.06
Essentially, the icon
is shown on most devices

12
00:00:31.06 --> 00:00:34.08
at 98 pixels by 98 pixels,

13
00:00:34.08 --> 00:00:36.09
but it's a good idea to design this

14
00:00:36.09 --> 00:00:39.09
at an 800 by 800 square at least

15
00:00:39.09 --> 00:00:45.02
for future-proofing, in case
Google makes some changes.

16
00:00:45.02 --> 00:00:48.06
Animated GIFs are not
allowed for your profile icon

17
00:00:48.06 --> 00:00:51.03
or your channel icon.

18
00:00:51.03 --> 00:00:53.06
And be sure that you
also avoid things like

19
00:00:53.06 --> 00:00:56.08
nudity, celebrities,
and copyrighted photos

20
00:00:56.08 --> 00:01:00.00
that you don't have the rights to.

21
00:01:00.00 --> 00:01:02.07
Now depending upon how you access this,

22
00:01:02.07 --> 00:01:06.02
it might be shown as a circle or a square,

23
00:01:06.02 --> 00:01:08.00
so it's important that you pay attention

24
00:01:08.00 --> 00:01:09.09
to this when designing.

25
00:01:09.09 --> 00:01:12.00
If it's a square logo,
you're going to want to

26
00:01:12.00 --> 00:01:16.06
shrink it down to fit
inside of a smaller circle.

27
00:01:16.06 --> 00:01:18.05
That's because, depending upon the device,

28
00:01:18.05 --> 00:01:20.05
it shows up differently.

29
00:01:20.05 --> 00:01:22.08
For example, for some odd reason,

30
00:01:22.08 --> 00:01:25.04
Google's desktop team tends to use

31
00:01:25.04 --> 00:01:28.09
a square icon when accessing YouTube.

32
00:01:28.09 --> 00:01:31.04
But if you browse on any
of their mobile devices,

33
00:01:31.04 --> 00:01:33.05
it shows up as a circle.

34
00:01:33.05 --> 00:01:36.00
This does mean that,
as you design an icon,

35
00:01:36.00 --> 00:01:38.07
it needs to work in both environments.

36
00:01:38.07 --> 00:01:42.05
Let's switch to a tool
like Adobe Photoshop.

37
00:01:42.05 --> 00:01:45.01
And what you'll wanna do
is create a new document

38
00:01:45.01 --> 00:01:47.08
and size it to be a square.

39
00:01:47.08 --> 00:01:52.06
Remember, the minimum
is 800 by 800 pixels.

40
00:01:52.06 --> 00:01:54.03
And click Create.

41
00:01:54.03 --> 00:01:58.08
Now you can use the command
File, Place Embedded,

42
00:01:58.08 --> 00:02:02.07
to navigate to another file.

43
00:02:02.07 --> 00:02:04.04
Inside of the exercise folder,

44
00:02:04.04 --> 00:02:06.02
I put a few items together.

45
00:02:06.02 --> 00:02:08.05
And from the logos folder here,

46
00:02:08.05 --> 00:02:13.05
I'm just going to choose this PNG icon.

47
00:02:13.05 --> 00:02:16.03
And click Place.

48
00:02:16.03 --> 00:02:18.06
I can adjust the size of this very easily,

49
00:02:18.06 --> 00:02:22.03
I'm just holding down
Shift + Alt to control it,

50
00:02:22.03 --> 00:02:26.04
and when I press Return,
it redraws the file.

51
00:02:26.04 --> 00:02:31.03
You can also do this with
vector files or other elements.

52
00:02:31.03 --> 00:02:34.09
You might choose to put a
sample color back there.

53
00:02:34.09 --> 00:02:37.04
So if I want a color, I
can load something that's

54
00:02:37.04 --> 00:02:41.06
complimentary and start to put it behind.

55
00:02:41.06 --> 00:02:46.08
I find that using the Hue
command can be quite useful.

56
00:02:46.08 --> 00:02:51.03
This way, I can easily
adjust the artwork behind

57
00:02:51.03 --> 00:02:56.09
until I find something
that's complimentary.

58
00:02:56.09 --> 00:02:59.03
And click OK.

59
00:02:59.03 --> 00:03:02.01
Then, simply save this.

60
00:03:02.01 --> 00:03:04.09
I suggest if using a tool like Photoshop,

61
00:03:04.09 --> 00:03:09.04
you use the Save for Web command,

62
00:03:09.04 --> 00:03:12.07
which is found under the Export menu,

63
00:03:12.07 --> 00:03:16.08
and this will allow you to
easily create a new file.

64
00:03:16.08 --> 00:03:22.05
For the social icon, a JPEG at
high quality is a good idea.

65
00:03:22.05 --> 00:03:26.05
Just click Save, and you
can create the new file.

66
00:03:26.05 --> 00:03:28.01
Now, I'll click Cancel because

67
00:03:28.01 --> 00:03:30.06
I've already made this icon for upload,

68
00:03:30.06 --> 00:03:33.01
but that's basically the workflow.

69
00:03:33.01 --> 00:03:36.04
Make a square, drag in a logo or a photo,

70
00:03:36.04 --> 00:03:38.05
and then save it out.

71
00:03:38.05 --> 00:03:41.02
Do keep in mind that the
logo might be cropped

72
00:03:41.02 --> 00:03:44.02
to a circle when displayed on YouTube.

73
00:03:44.02 --> 00:03:46.02
So if you place a square logo,

74
00:03:46.02 --> 00:03:49.00
you'll need to inset it
so it's a bit smaller

75
00:03:49.00 --> 00:03:51.03
and fits inside an inner circle.
