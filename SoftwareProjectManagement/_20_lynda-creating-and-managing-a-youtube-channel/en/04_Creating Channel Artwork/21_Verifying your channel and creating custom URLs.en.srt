1
00:00:00.05 --> 00:00:02.01
- Before you go forward and start to do

2
00:00:02.01 --> 00:00:03.05
more things with your channel,

3
00:00:03.05 --> 00:00:06.08
it's a good idea to verify your channel.

4
00:00:06.08 --> 00:00:09.07
YouTube wants a phone number
so they can reach you.

5
00:00:09.07 --> 00:00:11.04
And they're going to
send you a text message

6
00:00:11.04 --> 00:00:14.08
to your mobile device
to verify the account.

7
00:00:14.08 --> 00:00:16.02
The thought being is that

8
00:00:16.02 --> 00:00:18.08
people keep their phone
numbers for a long time;

9
00:00:18.08 --> 00:00:22.02
much longer than they do an
email address in most cases.

10
00:00:22.02 --> 00:00:24.00
So by verifying your account,

11
00:00:24.00 --> 00:00:26.01
additional features will become updated

12
00:00:26.01 --> 00:00:28.03
and the account will be much easier

13
00:00:28.03 --> 00:00:30.02
for people to search and find,

14
00:00:30.02 --> 00:00:32.00
as well as you'll see later,

15
00:00:32.00 --> 00:00:35.01
you can unlock advanced
tools like longer videos

16
00:00:35.01 --> 00:00:37.06
and other settings like streaming.

17
00:00:37.06 --> 00:00:40.05
To do this, you'll need a mobile phone.

18
00:00:40.05 --> 00:00:42.07
On the page, you're going
to want to make sure

19
00:00:42.07 --> 00:00:48.09
you're logged in and choose
to go to Creator Studio.

20
00:00:48.09 --> 00:00:52.06
Then, go to Channel,

21
00:00:52.06 --> 00:00:56.00
and click the Verify button.

22
00:00:56.00 --> 00:00:58.00
You'll see that until you verify,

23
00:00:58.00 --> 00:01:02.02
many other services are
marked as ineligible.

24
00:01:02.02 --> 00:01:04.07
Let's click Verify.

25
00:01:04.07 --> 00:01:08.09
It now asks me to choose a
country where you're based.

26
00:01:08.09 --> 00:01:11.00
You can get a phone call if you don't

27
00:01:11.00 --> 00:01:13.08
have a cell phone that
can get text messages,

28
00:01:13.08 --> 00:01:16.05
and Google will read
the number out to you.

29
00:01:16.05 --> 00:01:21.01
Or you can go ahead and have
them text you that information.

30
00:01:21.01 --> 00:01:25.08
When ready, click Submit.

31
00:01:25.08 --> 00:01:29.02
On your mobile device, you
may see a text message.

32
00:01:29.02 --> 00:01:31.05
If you're using a service
like Apple's Messages,

33
00:01:31.05 --> 00:01:34.09
it might appear on more than one device.

34
00:01:34.09 --> 00:01:39.08
This code is going to be
uniquely generated each time.

35
00:01:39.08 --> 00:01:46.01
Let's go ahead and enter that code in.

36
00:01:46.01 --> 00:01:49.00
And now it's verified.

37
00:01:49.00 --> 00:01:51.04
I can click Continue.

38
00:01:51.04 --> 00:01:52.05
You'll now see that access

39
00:01:52.05 --> 00:01:55.00
like longer videos become available.

40
00:01:55.00 --> 00:01:58.00
And options to live stream can be enabled.

41
00:01:58.00 --> 00:02:00.09
But we'll do that a little bit later.

42
00:02:00.09 --> 00:02:04.01
If we click through and take
a look at our account there,

43
00:02:04.01 --> 00:02:05.05
you'll star to see it.

44
00:02:05.05 --> 00:02:08.09
And now the page is verified.

45
00:02:08.09 --> 00:02:13.02
Let's go ahead here to
the actual Settings here.

46
00:02:13.02 --> 00:02:15.09
And I'll choose to take a quick look.

47
00:02:15.09 --> 00:02:18.02
Let's open up the Advanced tab,

48
00:02:18.02 --> 00:02:22.04
the Channel, and Editing on Google.

49
00:02:22.04 --> 00:02:24.05
Here you'll be able to see the info.

50
00:02:24.05 --> 00:02:33.00
Remember, you can click and
make updates quite simply.

51
00:02:33.00 --> 00:02:34.06
The phone number that you added

52
00:02:34.06 --> 00:02:37.08
has not yet appeared here on the page.

53
00:02:37.08 --> 00:02:41.04
Remember, you can click
to edit this information.

54
00:02:41.04 --> 00:02:43.04
If you want to add additional info.,

55
00:02:43.04 --> 00:02:45.09
clicking the Plus button
here is going to allow you

56
00:02:45.09 --> 00:02:51.07
to add contact information,
websites, or other content.

57
00:02:51.07 --> 00:02:54.07
I'll click Cancel for now.

58
00:02:54.07 --> 00:02:57.03
Additionally, the Verified
page is now going to be

59
00:02:57.03 --> 00:03:00.02
easier for people to find in Search.

60
00:03:00.02 --> 00:03:03.03
Let's go back to our channel
settings for a moment.

61
00:03:03.03 --> 00:03:07.06
And if I scroll down, you'll
see other options here.

62
00:03:07.06 --> 00:03:10.00
Including Custom URL.

63
00:03:10.00 --> 00:03:12.06
This is the last key
component to branding,

64
00:03:12.06 --> 00:03:15.02
however, I'm not currently eligible yet

65
00:03:15.02 --> 00:03:17.08
because I don't have enough subscribers.

66
00:03:17.08 --> 00:03:19.07
If you click on the link,

67
00:03:19.07 --> 00:03:21.05
you'll see that it gives you information

68
00:03:21.05 --> 00:03:24.06
about what it takes to become eligible.

69
00:03:24.06 --> 00:03:27.02
So for example, as the
general requirement,

70
00:03:27.02 --> 00:03:28.04
you see that you need to get

71
00:03:28.04 --> 00:03:30.06
up to a hundred or more subscribers,

72
00:03:30.06 --> 00:03:34.08
and that the account needs
to be at least 30 days old.

73
00:03:34.08 --> 00:03:37.01
You'll need to have
uploaded the channel icon

74
00:03:37.01 --> 00:03:38.06
and the channel art.

75
00:03:38.06 --> 00:03:42.09
So start posting videos and
getting other folks to join in.

76
00:03:42.09 --> 00:03:45.00
Once you get those hundred subscribers

77
00:03:45.00 --> 00:03:47.02
and your page is at least a month old,

78
00:03:47.02 --> 00:03:49.08
you'll be able to assign a custom URL

79
00:03:49.08 --> 00:03:52.09
which will make it that much
easier for people to find you

80
00:03:52.09 --> 00:03:55.05
when they start to search
for you on YouTube.
