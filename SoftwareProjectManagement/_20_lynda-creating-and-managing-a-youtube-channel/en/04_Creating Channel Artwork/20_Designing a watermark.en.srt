1
00:00:00.01 --> 00:00:01.09
- Another option you have that you can add

2
00:00:01.09 --> 00:00:05.01
to all of your videos
is a branding watermark.

3
00:00:05.01 --> 00:00:07.05
This is useful because
it essentially serves

4
00:00:07.05 --> 00:00:09.04
as a subscribe button,

5
00:00:09.04 --> 00:00:12.06
so as people watch your
video on other places

6
00:00:12.06 --> 00:00:15.02
such as Search, they're actually prompted

7
00:00:15.02 --> 00:00:17.01
and it has a little branding icon,

8
00:00:17.01 --> 00:00:20.02
to help establish who made the video.

9
00:00:20.02 --> 00:00:22.09
Let me show how this works,

10
00:00:22.09 --> 00:00:25.02
now the subscribe button is a watermark

11
00:00:25.02 --> 00:00:27.08
that goes over the corners of your video,

12
00:00:27.08 --> 00:00:30.06
and it will work if
the videos are embedded

13
00:00:30.06 --> 00:00:34.01
or shared on other platforms.

14
00:00:34.01 --> 00:00:36.08
When you add the watermark,
people can hover over it

15
00:00:36.08 --> 00:00:39.05
and if they click, it will subscribe them.

16
00:00:39.05 --> 00:00:42.02
Do keep in mind that this
subscription component

17
00:00:42.02 --> 00:00:47.01
only works on a desktop
computer at this time.

18
00:00:47.01 --> 00:00:48.05
It's not shown to people

19
00:00:48.05 --> 00:00:51.06
who've already subscribed to your video.

20
00:00:51.06 --> 00:00:53.01
Some people will add the word,

21
00:00:53.01 --> 00:00:55.01
subscribe to their button as well,

22
00:00:55.01 --> 00:00:57.04
it's up to you.

23
00:00:57.04 --> 00:01:00.07
It should be a PNG file
with transparency though,

24
00:01:00.07 --> 00:01:02.04
so use a graphics editing tool,

25
00:01:02.04 --> 00:01:06.00
like Photoshop or Photoshop
Elements to make this easier.

26
00:01:06.00 --> 00:01:08.07
Now with the watermark,
it's going to work in

27
00:01:08.07 --> 00:01:10.07
only specific circumstances,

28
00:01:10.07 --> 00:01:13.02
but in general these
are the most common ones

29
00:01:13.02 --> 00:01:15.03
and it's pretty useful.

30
00:01:15.03 --> 00:01:18.06
It will only work on videos
that are in landscape view,

31
00:01:18.06 --> 00:01:20.09
so if you're on a computer
or a mobile device

32
00:01:20.09 --> 00:01:22.09
that's turned into landscape view,

33
00:01:22.09 --> 00:01:25.02
you will see the watermark.

34
00:01:25.02 --> 00:01:29.00
But remember, the watermark
is not clickable on mobile,

35
00:01:29.00 --> 00:01:31.00
but it does serve to help brand

36
00:01:31.00 --> 00:01:32.05
and can get your identity out there

37
00:01:32.05 --> 00:01:37.00
to make it easier for people
to know what they're watching.

38
00:01:37.00 --> 00:01:39.01
The channel watermarks will not appear

39
00:01:39.01 --> 00:01:42.06
in custom YouTube players
or third party ones,

40
00:01:42.06 --> 00:01:44.04
or if you're using the older

41
00:01:44.04 --> 00:01:47.04
Adobe Flash based YouTube player.

42
00:01:47.04 --> 00:01:50.01
So how exactly do you add the watermark?

43
00:01:50.01 --> 00:01:51.08
Well it's essentially going to be

44
00:01:51.08 --> 00:01:54.07
a higher resolution social media icon,

45
00:01:54.07 --> 00:01:57.03
maybe the logo you made
for your channel icon

46
00:01:57.03 --> 00:02:02.01
but simplified to a simple,
single color, or fewer colors

47
00:02:02.01 --> 00:02:05.02
and make sure that it has transparency,

48
00:02:05.02 --> 00:02:07.00
then it's pretty simple.

49
00:02:07.00 --> 00:02:11.05
To add a watermark,
just sign into YouTube,

50
00:02:11.05 --> 00:02:14.00
go to the Creator Studio section

51
00:02:14.00 --> 00:02:18.01
and make sure that you
access all of the controls,

52
00:02:18.01 --> 00:02:23.04
from there, you can choose
Channel, and then Branding,

53
00:02:23.04 --> 00:02:27.02
click to add a watermark

54
00:02:27.02 --> 00:02:30.01
and then follow the
on-screen instructions.

55
00:02:30.01 --> 00:02:32.07
So let me show you,

56
00:02:32.07 --> 00:02:39.09
when I'm logged in, I'll go
ahead and choose Creator Studio,

57
00:02:39.09 --> 00:02:44.01
now I'll go to Channel,

58
00:02:44.01 --> 00:02:48.04
and select Branding.

59
00:02:48.04 --> 00:02:52.06
From here, click to add a watermark,

60
00:02:52.06 --> 00:02:54.06
it gives you a little bit
of additional information

61
00:02:54.06 --> 00:02:57.05
on what it thinks works best,

62
00:02:57.05 --> 00:03:02.01
choose the file and
I've already placed one

63
00:03:02.01 --> 00:03:04.03
inside a folder for here,

64
00:03:04.03 --> 00:03:08.08
I'm just going to choose the PNG file,

65
00:03:08.08 --> 00:03:13.02
here's a larger one, that's not square,

66
00:03:13.02 --> 00:03:17.00
and here's a smaller
one, let's click Choose.

67
00:03:17.00 --> 00:03:21.06
When ready I can click Save,
and it should add it in,

68
00:03:21.06 --> 00:03:27.09
there it is, looks good
and I'll click Save.

69
00:03:27.09 --> 00:03:28.09
It gives you a preview

70
00:03:28.09 --> 00:03:32.06
of what it's going to
look like over the video,

71
00:03:32.06 --> 00:03:36.06
you could decide how long you
want to wait for it to appear,

72
00:03:36.06 --> 00:03:38.05
many folks wait a few seconds

73
00:03:38.05 --> 00:03:43.00
after the video starts so
it appears and fades on,

74
00:03:43.00 --> 00:03:46.03
but you can decide if you want
it up for the entire video

75
00:03:46.03 --> 00:03:49.05
or how close it comes up to
the end as a call to action

76
00:03:49.05 --> 00:03:51.03
when people are watching,

77
00:03:51.03 --> 00:03:54.01
I generally recommend a custom start time

78
00:03:54.01 --> 00:03:57.04
or the entire video duration,

79
00:03:57.04 --> 00:04:01.04
then just click Update to have it store,

80
00:04:01.04 --> 00:04:02.08
and it's now saved.
