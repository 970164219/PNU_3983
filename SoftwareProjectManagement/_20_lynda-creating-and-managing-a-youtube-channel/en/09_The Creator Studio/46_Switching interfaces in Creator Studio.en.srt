00:00:00.05 --> 00:00:02.01
- [Instructor] If you've
been watching this course,

2
00:00:02.01 --> 00:00:04.00
you've probably already seen me switch

3
00:00:04.00 --> 00:00:07.02
between the two versions
of YouTube's controls.

4
00:00:07.02 --> 00:00:09.06
If you just jumped to
this particular chapter,

5
00:00:09.06 --> 00:00:12.07
well let's make sure that you
know how to actually migrate

6
00:00:12.07 --> 00:00:15.03
between the two different
versions of YouTube,

7
00:00:15.03 --> 00:00:17.03
but let's start with the simple question,

8
00:00:17.03 --> 00:00:20.01
why are there tow different
versions of YouTube?

9
00:00:20.01 --> 00:00:23.09
Well, YouTube is in the process
of dramatically changing

10
00:00:23.09 --> 00:00:27.00
their user interface
for the backend controls

11
00:00:27.00 --> 00:00:29.02
and that's mostly a good thing.

12
00:00:29.02 --> 00:00:31.06
However, anytime you're
going to take controls

13
00:00:31.06 --> 00:00:34.09
that have been well-established
and around for a long time,

14
00:00:34.09 --> 00:00:40.07
it's going to be A hard, B
bothersome to many people,

15
00:00:40.07 --> 00:00:46.00
and C take a lot of time so
this is a work in progress.

16
00:00:46.00 --> 00:00:48.09
And as such, YouTube is going pretty slow.

17
00:00:48.09 --> 00:00:50.08
They've been at this at
the time of recording

18
00:00:50.08 --> 00:00:52.00
for almost two years

19
00:00:52.00 --> 00:00:54.00
and there are still tons of features

20
00:00:54.00 --> 00:00:56.04
that haven't made it to the new look.

21
00:00:56.04 --> 00:00:58.07
So if you want to use the new studio,

22
00:00:58.07 --> 00:01:02.06
make sure you're using a
newer version of YouTube

23
00:01:02.06 --> 00:01:05.07
by switching first to the
Google Chrome browser.

24
00:01:05.07 --> 00:01:07.09
It is supported in a
couple of other browsers,

25
00:01:07.09 --> 00:01:09.00
but generally speaking,

26
00:01:09.00 --> 00:01:11.02
Google Chrome is going to work the best

27
00:01:11.02 --> 00:01:12.01
so let me show you that.

28
00:01:12.01 --> 00:01:14.00
If you are logged in to Google Chrome

29
00:01:14.00 --> 00:01:15.07
and you're looking at this view,

30
00:01:15.07 --> 00:01:17.08
this is the new YouTube

31
00:01:17.08 --> 00:01:20.05
and the controls for
analytics and comments

32
00:01:20.05 --> 00:01:23.07
are really quite nice
and visually pleasing,

33
00:01:23.07 --> 00:01:25.04
but you might see this other view

34
00:01:25.04 --> 00:01:29.02
referred to as Studio Classic.

35
00:01:29.02 --> 00:01:31.03
This is the view that's much more common

36
00:01:31.03 --> 00:01:33.05
and that we've been looking
at for most of the course

37
00:01:33.05 --> 00:01:36.04
and as you see there
are many more sections

38
00:01:36.04 --> 00:01:40.09
and many more different types
of titles and breakdowns.

39
00:01:40.09 --> 00:01:43.04
If you want to see this view, that's fine.

40
00:01:43.04 --> 00:01:46.01
And when you click on
your channel icon here

41
00:01:46.01 --> 00:01:48.04
and you switch to Creator Studio,

42
00:01:48.04 --> 00:01:50.02
that's what you're going to get.

43
00:01:50.02 --> 00:01:52.09
But near the bottom is a choice that says

44
00:01:52.09 --> 00:01:55.07
use the YouTube Studio Beta

45
00:01:55.07 --> 00:01:59.01
and clicking this will switch
you over to the newer version

46
00:01:59.01 --> 00:02:03.09
which is a little bit more
visually rich and easier to use.

47
00:02:03.09 --> 00:02:05.06
The only challenges you'll notice here

48
00:02:05.06 --> 00:02:07.00
with missing features,

49
00:02:07.00 --> 00:02:10.00
it has a ton of features missing

50
00:02:10.00 --> 00:02:13.02
and so this will help you
understand what's going on.

51
00:02:13.02 --> 00:02:16.03
If we take a look at the
what's new section here,

52
00:02:16.03 --> 00:02:18.06
you'll see a nice breakdown
where they tell you

53
00:02:18.06 --> 00:02:21.02
what's happening with the YouTube Beta

54
00:02:21.02 --> 00:02:23.07
and what features are being added,

55
00:02:23.07 --> 00:02:28.00
how can you comment to add
more, and what's going on.

56
00:02:28.00 --> 00:02:29.07
Additionally under settings,

57
00:02:29.07 --> 00:02:33.06
you can decide which version
you use for a control.

58
00:02:33.06 --> 00:02:37.01
I find at this point that
the Creator Studio Classic

59
00:02:37.01 --> 00:02:39.07
is the one that I have
to use most of the time

60
00:02:39.07 --> 00:02:41.01
to get things done.

61
00:02:41.01 --> 00:02:44.06
But if I just want to take a
look at statistics or comments,

62
00:02:44.06 --> 00:02:47.00
well the new YouTube Studio Beta

63
00:02:47.00 --> 00:02:49.00
is a little bit more visually pleasing

64
00:02:49.00 --> 00:02:50.07
and easier to navigate.

65
00:02:50.07 --> 00:02:53.00
For many, you'll use
Creator Studio Classic

66
00:02:53.00 --> 00:02:55.00
when you're first configuring your channel

67
00:02:55.00 --> 00:02:57.02
and then switch to the new Beta version

68
00:02:57.02 --> 00:03:01.02
for just browsing comments and
looking at analytics later on

69
00:03:01.02 --> 00:03:02.09
once you're established.

70
00:03:02.09 --> 00:03:05.06
In any case, realizing
that there's two versions

71
00:03:05.06 --> 00:03:08.03
of the software is important.

72
00:03:08.03 --> 00:03:10.09
And keep in mind that this is Google

73
00:03:10.09 --> 00:03:12.06
and Google likes change

74
00:03:12.06 --> 00:03:16.03
and I've seen features come
to YouTube and disappear

75
00:03:16.03 --> 00:03:17.09
only to come back later.

76
00:03:17.09 --> 00:03:20.07
I've seen features that
were wildly popular

77
00:03:20.07 --> 00:03:21.09
suddenly go missing

78
00:03:21.09 --> 00:03:25.02
or get replaced with
something entirely new.

79
00:03:25.02 --> 00:03:28.02
YouTube is not terribly consistent

80
00:03:28.02 --> 00:03:31.08
and things will move, will
change, will get added,

81
00:03:31.08 --> 00:03:33.03
and will get dropped.

82
00:03:33.03 --> 00:03:34.09
As such, you need to pay attention

83
00:03:34.09 --> 00:03:38.01
to the core concepts of the navigation.

84
00:03:38.01 --> 00:03:40.07
Use the left-hand panel to find the area

85
00:03:40.07 --> 00:03:43.02
that generally describes
what you want to do

86
00:03:43.02 --> 00:03:46.00
and then look at the
different settings underneath

87
00:03:46.00 --> 00:03:48.00
and be prepared that many features

88
00:03:48.00 --> 00:03:51.09
that you've used for a long
time suddenly disappear.

89
00:03:51.09 --> 00:03:54.05
I was a big fan of an old
feature called fan finder

90
00:03:54.05 --> 00:03:57.04
that made it easier to
connect with your audience.

91
00:03:57.04 --> 00:03:59.04
Well, YouTube decided to get rid of it

92
00:03:59.04 --> 00:04:02.04
or make it available only
to certain types of accounts

93
00:04:02.04 --> 00:04:04.04
that mine wasn't one of.

94
00:04:04.04 --> 00:04:08.02
So in any case, being familiar
with the Creator Studio

95
00:04:08.02 --> 00:04:11.01
or the new YouTube Studio is important

96
00:04:11.01 --> 00:04:13.09
and knowing how to switch
between them will be helpful

97
00:04:13.09 --> 00:04:16.00
so you can find the tools that you need.
