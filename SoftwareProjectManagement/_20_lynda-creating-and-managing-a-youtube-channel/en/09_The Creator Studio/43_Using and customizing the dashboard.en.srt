1
00:00:00.07 --> 00:00:02.07
- When you log into Creator Studio

2
00:00:02.07 --> 00:00:05.03
there's an initial view
called the Dashboard

3
00:00:05.03 --> 00:00:08.03
where you can get a good
overview of your content.

4
00:00:08.03 --> 00:00:09.08
Let me show you how it works.

5
00:00:09.08 --> 00:00:10.09
With the Dashboard,

6
00:00:10.09 --> 00:00:14.05
you can control what
information YouTube shows you.

7
00:00:14.05 --> 00:00:16.07
Now, you can dig deeper into any section

8
00:00:16.07 --> 00:00:18.03
and some sections will provide

9
00:00:18.03 --> 00:00:20.05
a certain level of customization.

10
00:00:20.05 --> 00:00:21.09
In order to view this,

11
00:00:21.09 --> 00:00:23.08
just go to Creator Studio

12
00:00:23.08 --> 00:00:27.05
and visit the top tab for Dashboard.

13
00:00:27.05 --> 00:00:29.09
Your view may look a little bit different.

14
00:00:29.09 --> 00:00:33.08
You'll notice if you scroll
down there's different areas.

15
00:00:33.08 --> 00:00:37.04
And these areas can be navigated to.

16
00:00:37.04 --> 00:00:39.02
Clicking on the settings
icon, for example,

17
00:00:39.02 --> 00:00:46.03
controls how many items are
shown here for comments.

18
00:00:46.03 --> 00:00:47.08
And it updates.

19
00:00:47.08 --> 00:00:49.07
If I want to remove a section,

20
00:00:49.07 --> 00:00:53.02
I can click and it goes away.

21
00:00:53.02 --> 00:00:56.03
That's easy enough.

22
00:00:56.03 --> 00:00:58.02
Maybe I decide that I want to

23
00:00:58.02 --> 00:01:00.03
get rid of the What's New section.

24
00:01:00.03 --> 00:01:03.02
Well, now it's not cluttered.

25
00:01:03.02 --> 00:01:07.03
But, you'll see here that
sections can be dragged,

26
00:01:07.03 --> 00:01:10.04
and reordered.

27
00:01:10.04 --> 00:01:12.03
Giving you a little bit of flexibility

28
00:01:12.03 --> 00:01:14.09
on the content itself.

29
00:01:14.09 --> 00:01:16.06
You see it reflows.

30
00:01:16.06 --> 00:01:18.08
Now, what you have the option for here

31
00:01:18.08 --> 00:01:20.06
is clicking the little pad here

32
00:01:20.06 --> 00:01:23.06
will give you the ability to move that.

33
00:01:23.06 --> 00:01:25.05
If you click View all,

34
00:01:25.05 --> 00:01:28.09
it'll dig into the tile and
show you more information.

35
00:01:28.09 --> 00:01:31.06
In this case, on Analytics.

36
00:01:31.06 --> 00:01:34.01
So this does make it pretty simple.

37
00:01:34.01 --> 00:01:36.03
Now, when you go back you might notice

38
00:01:36.03 --> 00:01:38.02
that some things come back here

39
00:01:38.02 --> 00:01:40.09
and it's going to tell you
more about other options.

40
00:01:40.09 --> 00:01:42.06
So, for example, it tells me here

41
00:01:42.06 --> 00:01:45.00
I can add a customized
notification widget.

42
00:01:45.00 --> 00:01:47.00
It's just prompting me.

43
00:01:47.00 --> 00:01:50.03
So, if I click that there, it's
going to give me some tips.

44
00:01:50.03 --> 00:01:53.02
So it just suggested
that I add that back in.

45
00:01:53.02 --> 00:01:54.09
If I click Add widget here,

46
00:01:54.09 --> 00:01:57.03
you'll see there are some other options.

47
00:01:57.03 --> 00:01:59.04
So, if I want to know what's new,

48
00:01:59.04 --> 00:02:01.08
I click and it comes back.

49
00:02:01.08 --> 00:02:06.02
And this gives me those articles.

50
00:02:06.02 --> 00:02:09.05
If I decide to, I can move
that to a different location.

51
00:02:09.05 --> 00:02:12.05
Some tiles or widgets
actually have a gear icon

52
00:02:12.05 --> 00:02:14.02
and you'll see that you can name it.

53
00:02:14.02 --> 00:02:16.09
So, I made one called Published Videos

54
00:02:16.09 --> 00:02:20.02
and told it to show the
four videos that are public.

55
00:02:20.02 --> 00:02:23.09
On the other hand, I also
made another widget down here

56
00:02:23.09 --> 00:02:25.07
that was set to show me four videos

57
00:02:25.07 --> 00:02:28.03
that were currently set to private

58
00:02:28.03 --> 00:02:31.02
or, perhaps, that were unlisted.

59
00:02:31.02 --> 00:02:34.07
This makes it easy to track
different types of content.

60
00:02:34.07 --> 00:02:37.00
Or you can do a custom search here

61
00:02:37.00 --> 00:02:39.05
and set a key word or other area.

62
00:02:39.05 --> 00:02:41.04
Clicking here for advanced search

63
00:02:41.04 --> 00:02:43.02
will give you some particular tips

64
00:02:43.02 --> 00:02:48.00
and recipes on which
parameters you can search for.

65
00:02:48.00 --> 00:02:49.05
Now, this is easy enough

66
00:02:49.05 --> 00:02:51.03
and just take a look at
the different widgets

67
00:02:51.03 --> 00:02:52.08
and options you have.

68
00:02:52.08 --> 00:02:54.06
The big thing here is you can really add

69
00:02:54.06 --> 00:02:57.01
a lot of different video widgets.

70
00:02:57.01 --> 00:02:58.06
Clicking here on the settings

71
00:02:58.06 --> 00:03:00.04
are going to allow you to customize that

72
00:03:00.04 --> 00:03:02.03
and you can easily tell it to look

73
00:03:02.03 --> 00:03:04.08
for particular types of content.

74
00:03:04.08 --> 00:03:08.00
Remember, the Custom search
is the most powerful way

75
00:03:08.00 --> 00:03:11.05
to find particular videos
that are doing well.

76
00:03:11.05 --> 00:03:14.03
For example, if I say search for custom

77
00:03:14.03 --> 00:03:17.07
I can search for a particular title.

78
00:03:17.07 --> 00:03:20.06
Let's do a copy here.

79
00:03:20.06 --> 00:03:27.08
And I'll say search for videos
who's title contains Luminar.

80
00:03:27.08 --> 00:03:29.09
And I'll click Save.

81
00:03:29.09 --> 00:03:32.08
And you see that it found
all of those videos.

82
00:03:32.08 --> 00:03:35.02
So if I want to track
a particular campaign

83
00:03:35.02 --> 00:03:37.03
and see how those videos are doing,

84
00:03:37.03 --> 00:03:39.06
well, this makes it
easy to track a keyword

85
00:03:39.06 --> 00:03:42.04
or engagement within my channel.

86
00:03:42.04 --> 00:03:45.05
There are lots of different
ways to do custom searches.

87
00:03:45.05 --> 00:03:48.08
But customizing this
Dashboard is a good idea.

88
00:03:48.08 --> 00:03:52.04
Now, if you take a look at
the newer YouTube Studio,

89
00:03:52.04 --> 00:03:54.09
what you'll notice is that customization

90
00:03:54.09 --> 00:03:57.05
really isn't much of an option.

91
00:03:57.05 --> 00:04:00.00
We can go here to different
tabs like Analytics

92
00:04:00.00 --> 00:04:01.07
and we'll talk more about these analytics.

93
00:04:01.07 --> 00:04:03.09
I actually think they're very well done.

94
00:04:03.09 --> 00:04:05.04
But, under settings here,

95
00:04:05.04 --> 00:04:08.03
you really only have one choice which is

96
00:04:08.03 --> 00:04:11.01
show me the old one or
show me the new one.

97
00:04:11.01 --> 00:04:13.06
And you just don't have
the level of control

98
00:04:13.06 --> 00:04:16.07
that you do inside of
Creator Studio Classic,

99
00:04:16.07 --> 00:04:19.05
which is why YouTube is
still making both available

100
00:04:19.05 --> 00:04:21.00
for some time to come.
