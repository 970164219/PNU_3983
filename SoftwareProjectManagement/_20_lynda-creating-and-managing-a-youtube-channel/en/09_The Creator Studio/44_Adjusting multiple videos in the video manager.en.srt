1
00:00:00.05 --> 00:00:03.07
- Earlier, we talked about
modifying multiple videos.

2
00:00:03.07 --> 00:00:06.04
I just want to quickly
revisit the video manager

3
00:00:06.04 --> 00:00:10.01
to show you how useful it
is for doing bulk edits.

4
00:00:10.01 --> 00:00:13.04
The video manager lets you
see all of your content,

5
00:00:13.04 --> 00:00:16.08
and with the ability to browse
and select multiple files,

6
00:00:16.08 --> 00:00:20.01
it's quite easy to then make a change.

7
00:00:20.01 --> 00:00:23.04
Let's go to the video manager here.

8
00:00:23.04 --> 00:00:24.07
One thing I like to do is

9
00:00:24.07 --> 00:00:27.07
browse the content and look for issues.

10
00:00:27.07 --> 00:00:30.01
For example, here's a spelling mistake,

11
00:00:30.01 --> 00:00:33.04
or more appropriately, a grammar mistake.

12
00:00:33.04 --> 00:00:38.01
I can click Edit, and it
takes me right to that video.

13
00:00:38.01 --> 00:00:43.02
I can add the apostrophe,
and click Save Changes,

14
00:00:43.02 --> 00:00:47.02
and just go back to my video manager.

15
00:00:47.02 --> 00:00:50.03
As you see here, it makes it
easy to browse to find things,

16
00:00:50.03 --> 00:00:52.08
so being able to just
look at all your videos

17
00:00:52.08 --> 00:00:55.04
will help you spot problems.

18
00:00:55.04 --> 00:00:58.05
For example, this one
here needs a better title.

19
00:00:58.05 --> 00:01:00.06
I'll fix that later.

20
00:01:00.06 --> 00:01:02.02
And it makes it really simple

21
00:01:02.02 --> 00:01:05.02
to find and browse your content.

22
00:01:05.02 --> 00:01:08.04
Now remember, you do have
the ability to search here,

23
00:01:08.04 --> 00:01:12.02
so I'm going to search
on the word Photoshop,

24
00:01:12.02 --> 00:01:16.01
and press Return.

25
00:01:16.01 --> 00:01:18.06
It's found all of those videos.

26
00:01:18.06 --> 00:01:19.09
In this case, videos where

27
00:01:19.09 --> 00:01:22.09
the word Photoshop appears inside.

28
00:01:22.09 --> 00:01:24.06
If we click here to see the option,

29
00:01:24.06 --> 00:01:26.06
we can be more specific.

30
00:01:26.06 --> 00:01:28.05
Maybe I want to search for videos

31
00:01:28.05 --> 00:01:31.06
that have Photoshop in the title.

32
00:01:31.06 --> 00:01:34.06
I'll click Search.

33
00:01:34.06 --> 00:01:37.05
And that gives me a much smaller list.

34
00:01:37.05 --> 00:01:40.06
So you see, the ability
here works quite well.

35
00:01:40.06 --> 00:01:42.03
Using the advanced search,

36
00:01:42.03 --> 00:01:46.00
you can actually look and
find things quite simply.

37
00:01:46.00 --> 00:01:48.06
And remember, not only
can we search on title,

38
00:01:48.06 --> 00:01:50.08
but we can also search for other words,

39
00:01:50.08 --> 00:01:54.07
or only videos that are
currently publicly viewable.

40
00:01:54.07 --> 00:01:56.06
Now when I click Update here,

41
00:01:56.06 --> 00:02:00.02
it's going to give me better results.

42
00:02:00.02 --> 00:02:02.03
Now what I'm going to do is actually go in

43
00:02:02.03 --> 00:02:04.02
and do a search here for videos

44
00:02:04.02 --> 00:02:07.02
that are currently unlisted or private

45
00:02:07.02 --> 00:02:10.06
that have the word Photoshop in the title.

46
00:02:10.06 --> 00:02:13.01
I want to make sure that
those can be readily found.

47
00:02:13.01 --> 00:02:15.05
So now I see two videos.

48
00:02:15.05 --> 00:02:18.04
Well, I'm going to select those.

49
00:02:18.04 --> 00:02:21.08
I can select just one or
click to choose all of them,

50
00:02:21.08 --> 00:02:24.00
and I want to choose an option here.

51
00:02:24.00 --> 00:02:28.06
I'm going to say that I want to
change the privacy to Public.

52
00:02:28.06 --> 00:02:32.09
And I'm going to submit.

53
00:02:32.09 --> 00:02:35.02
And the change is made.

54
00:02:35.02 --> 00:02:37.00
Now, while the edit is being made,

55
00:02:37.00 --> 00:02:39.09
you'll see pending edit at the top,

56
00:02:39.09 --> 00:02:42.05
but this does make it simple to find

57
00:02:42.05 --> 00:02:45.07
and make changes to
multiple videos at once.

58
00:02:45.07 --> 00:02:49.06
By moving these videos from
Private or Unlisted to Public,

59
00:02:49.06 --> 00:02:55.02
they should get many more views.

60
00:02:55.02 --> 00:02:57.00
Let's go ahead and select those again,

61
00:02:57.00 --> 00:02:59.00
and I'll choose another action.

62
00:02:59.00 --> 00:03:02.06
In this case, I want to make
sure that these are available

63
00:03:02.06 --> 00:03:08.02
with a standard YouTube license.

64
00:03:08.02 --> 00:03:11.05
And I'll click Submit.

65
00:03:11.05 --> 00:03:13.08
And the change is made.

66
00:03:13.08 --> 00:03:16.08
Now, unfortunately, you can't
make multiple selections

67
00:03:16.08 --> 00:03:19.08
before applying it, but
this is still much faster

68
00:03:19.08 --> 00:03:23.04
than going through and editing
each video one at a time.

69
00:03:23.04 --> 00:03:25.07
The ability to use the video manager

70
00:03:25.07 --> 00:03:28.03
puts you in control of your content.

71
00:03:28.03 --> 00:03:29.07
Make sure you take advantage of

72
00:03:29.07 --> 00:03:31.07
some of its batch uploading ability

73
00:03:31.07 --> 00:03:33.04
as well as using it as a tool

74
00:03:33.04 --> 00:03:35.06
to search and find multiple videos

75
00:03:35.06 --> 00:03:37.08
to add them to specific playlists.
