1
00:00:00.05 --> 00:00:02.08
- There are a lot of
features for a channel

2
00:00:02.08 --> 00:00:05.03
that you might not yet be eligible for

3
00:00:05.03 --> 00:00:07.06
depending upon how many views you have.

4
00:00:07.06 --> 00:00:10.00
Or there could be features
that are available

5
00:00:10.00 --> 00:00:11.07
that you've just not turned on yet.

6
00:00:11.07 --> 00:00:14.07
Let's talk about the channel controls.

7
00:00:14.07 --> 00:00:16.03
When you log in to your channel,

8
00:00:16.03 --> 00:00:19.08
you'll see that you have
access to different services.

9
00:00:19.08 --> 00:00:23.00
This is where you can also check
the status for your channel

10
00:00:23.00 --> 00:00:24.08
and this is quite important.

11
00:00:24.08 --> 00:00:27.04
You want to make sure that
you don't have any violations

12
00:00:27.04 --> 00:00:30.02
for community guidelines such as offensive

13
00:00:30.02 --> 00:00:32.07
or hateful content or comments,

14
00:00:32.07 --> 00:00:34.08
and you want to make sure
that you have not had

15
00:00:34.08 --> 00:00:38.05
any strikes against you
for copyright violations.

16
00:00:38.05 --> 00:00:40.07
So, let's go ahead and switch over here.

17
00:00:40.07 --> 00:00:44.06
If I log in and take a look
at my channel as a whole,

18
00:00:44.06 --> 00:00:46.09
I'll see information.

19
00:00:46.09 --> 00:00:50.06
For example, I notice that
my account has been verified

20
00:00:50.06 --> 00:00:53.07
and that I'm in great
shape for both copyright

21
00:00:53.07 --> 00:00:56.01
and community guidelines.

22
00:00:56.01 --> 00:00:58.02
Most of my features have been enabled.

23
00:00:58.02 --> 00:01:03.03
However, my monetization has
not been completely turned on.

24
00:01:03.03 --> 00:01:06.03
So if I click on this tile,
I can check the status

25
00:01:06.03 --> 00:01:08.00
and see where I'm at.

26
00:01:08.00 --> 00:01:10.00
I see, for example, that I am allowed

27
00:01:10.00 --> 00:01:13.03
to use the Video Manager
to monetize with ads,

28
00:01:13.03 --> 00:01:16.05
so that's great, but I can
find out more information here

29
00:01:16.05 --> 00:01:20.00
about doing that and enable a few ads.

30
00:01:20.00 --> 00:01:23.00
If I take a look her, I see
that I'm not currently eligible

31
00:01:23.00 --> 00:01:24.05
for sponsorships.

32
00:01:24.05 --> 00:01:27.06
Well, that's because this
is only for gaming channels

33
00:01:27.06 --> 00:01:29.05
and I'm ineligible.

34
00:01:29.05 --> 00:01:32.00
But each tile becomes available.

35
00:01:32.00 --> 00:01:34.05
So I'm available for a custom URL.

36
00:01:34.05 --> 00:01:36.02
It's enabled.

37
00:01:36.02 --> 00:01:38.06
Now, let's switch back
to the newer account

38
00:01:38.06 --> 00:01:40.05
that we recently set up.

39
00:01:40.05 --> 00:01:42.00
You'll see that we're in good shape

40
00:01:42.00 --> 00:01:44.02
for copyright and community guidelines

41
00:01:44.02 --> 00:01:47.02
and that the account is verified.

42
00:01:47.02 --> 00:01:52.05
However, we're not yet
eligible for monetization.

43
00:01:52.05 --> 00:01:55.01
That's because I have certain
steps that I have to set up

44
00:01:55.01 --> 00:01:56.01
and it prompts me.

45
00:01:56.01 --> 00:01:58.09
I have to specify what country I'm in.

46
00:01:58.09 --> 00:02:00.07
I'm eligible for live streaming,

47
00:02:00.07 --> 00:02:02.04
but it hasn't been turned on.

48
00:02:02.04 --> 00:02:06.00
So let's go ahead and click Enable.

49
00:02:06.00 --> 00:02:09.01
In doing this, it tells me that
it's going to take 24 hours

50
00:02:09.01 --> 00:02:11.07
to set up my account, which is fine,

51
00:02:11.07 --> 00:02:15.00
but now it's going to be
enabled for live streaming.

52
00:02:15.00 --> 00:02:16.07
If I go back to channels here,

53
00:02:16.07 --> 00:02:20.06
I'll see a status that says On Hold.

54
00:02:20.06 --> 00:02:22.09
Now, because it's not
enabled for live streaming,

55
00:02:22.09 --> 00:02:26.01
we don't have embedding
yet, so once this comes on,

56
00:02:26.01 --> 00:02:28.05
this option should become available.

57
00:02:28.05 --> 00:02:31.04
I notice that most other
features are enabled

58
00:02:31.04 --> 00:02:35.04
but, for example, I'm not
yet eligible for Super Chat

59
00:02:35.04 --> 00:02:38.00
because I don't have enough viewers

60
00:02:38.00 --> 00:02:40.06
and I'm not eligible for a custom URL

61
00:02:40.06 --> 00:02:43.08
because I haven't
received 100 subscribers.

62
00:02:43.08 --> 00:02:46.04
But I can check the
eligibility requirements here

63
00:02:46.04 --> 00:02:48.09
and I see exactly what I need.

64
00:02:48.09 --> 00:02:52.00
So in order to be eligible,
it says that, currently,

65
00:02:52.00 --> 00:02:54.00
the account has to be 30 days old

66
00:02:54.00 --> 00:02:56.02
with 100 or more subscribers.

67
00:02:56.02 --> 00:02:59.00
Well, this account is barely a day old

68
00:02:59.00 --> 00:03:01.05
and only has one subscriber

69
00:03:01.05 --> 00:03:02.09
because I haven't actually promoted it

70
00:03:02.09 --> 00:03:04.06
or put any content up.

71
00:03:04.06 --> 00:03:09.03
But I do have a photo for the
icon and custom channel art.

72
00:03:09.03 --> 00:03:12.03
So the dashboard here
is a great way to see

73
00:03:12.03 --> 00:03:16.02
where your account stands,
what features can you turn on,

74
00:03:16.02 --> 00:03:18.02
what features are you eligible for,

75
00:03:18.02 --> 00:03:21.09
and what does it take to become
eligible for new features.

76
00:03:21.09 --> 00:03:24.08
Very importantly, you can see information

77
00:03:24.08 --> 00:03:27.08
about if your account is in good standing

78
00:03:27.08 --> 00:03:30.01
and is it verified.

79
00:03:30.01 --> 00:03:32.06
Remember, being in good
standing is necessary

80
00:03:32.06 --> 00:03:34.05
so they don't take your page down.

81
00:03:34.05 --> 00:03:36.08
And if your account is not verified,

82
00:03:36.08 --> 00:03:40.05
the videos you upload
can be only very short.

83
00:03:40.05 --> 00:03:42.05
Google needs to have contact information

84
00:03:42.05 --> 00:03:46.00
to let you allow videos up that
are longer than 15 minutes.

85
00:03:46.00 --> 00:03:48.09
And there are other features
to verify the account as well,

86
00:03:48.09 --> 00:03:51.08
including the ability to
recover a lost password

87
00:03:51.08 --> 00:03:54.03
or other problems that might happen.

88
00:03:54.03 --> 00:03:57.00
Verification is a great way to make sure

89
00:03:57.00 --> 00:03:59.04
you stay in control of
your YouTube account

90
00:03:59.04 --> 00:04:03.00
and these channel controls
give you a lot more options

91
00:04:03.00 --> 00:04:05.06
that put you in control of your content.
