1
00:00:00.06 --> 00:00:02.07
- Now, you might be feeling
a little bit confused

2
00:00:02.07 --> 00:00:05.02
because there's a whole lot
of different things happening

3
00:00:05.02 --> 00:00:06.08
when you log into YouTube.

4
00:00:06.08 --> 00:00:10.01
Multiple people controlling one page,

5
00:00:10.01 --> 00:00:11.08
with one name on one thing,

6
00:00:11.08 --> 00:00:13.06
and one name on another.

7
00:00:13.06 --> 00:00:15.03
And, you're in charge.

8
00:00:15.03 --> 00:00:18.00
Now, there are some benefits
to setting up a channel,

9
00:00:18.00 --> 00:00:19.04
and there are some drawbacks.

10
00:00:19.04 --> 00:00:21.00
So, let's get these out of the way,

11
00:00:21.00 --> 00:00:22.07
so you know why you
might want to go through

12
00:00:22.07 --> 00:00:23.08
all of this effort

13
00:00:23.08 --> 00:00:26.02
and what you need to
really keep an eye on.

14
00:00:26.02 --> 00:00:28.00
The benefits of setting up a channel

15
00:00:28.00 --> 00:00:30.00
include an increased presence.

16
00:00:30.00 --> 00:00:31.05
This gives you the ability

17
00:00:31.05 --> 00:00:34.09
of keeping all of your content
organized in one place,

18
00:00:34.09 --> 00:00:36.02
which makes it easier to find

19
00:00:36.02 --> 00:00:38.04
and easier to brand.

20
00:00:38.04 --> 00:00:42.00
This will make it a lot simpler
for people to find content,

21
00:00:42.00 --> 00:00:44.00
and to remember where they saw it.

22
00:00:44.00 --> 00:00:47.01
Now, a lot of people end
up just watching videos,

23
00:00:47.01 --> 00:00:50.01
particularly because YouTube
starts to auto suggest videos

24
00:00:50.01 --> 00:00:52.07
that are similar from
one topic to another.

25
00:00:52.07 --> 00:00:54.06
This is a very common phenomenon,

26
00:00:54.06 --> 00:00:58.00
and people will spend hours
watching video after video.

27
00:00:58.00 --> 00:01:00.00
But, maybe you break through.

28
00:01:00.00 --> 00:01:02.02
Maybe you find something
of interest to them

29
00:01:02.02 --> 00:01:04.01
and you capture their attention.

30
00:01:04.01 --> 00:01:06.02
Well, then that works out pretty well

31
00:01:06.02 --> 00:01:08.03
because you're able to actually take that

32
00:01:08.03 --> 00:01:10.08
and pull them back to
a central landing page

33
00:01:10.08 --> 00:01:14.05
where they can see more videos.

34
00:01:14.05 --> 00:01:16.08
What's also nice is that a channel

35
00:01:16.08 --> 00:01:20.00
can be shared with multiple
contributors or managers.

36
00:01:20.00 --> 00:01:22.02
I mentioned Photofocus earlier,

37
00:01:22.02 --> 00:01:23.08
and in this case, what happens is

38
00:01:23.08 --> 00:01:27.05
we have multiple people
that are publishing content.

39
00:01:27.05 --> 00:01:29.02
I've gotten authors, and editors,

40
00:01:29.02 --> 00:01:32.02
and people who host podcasts and webinars,

41
00:01:32.02 --> 00:01:35.00
and they all need access to the page.

42
00:01:35.00 --> 00:01:38.00
I'm able to give them the
ability to post content

43
00:01:38.00 --> 00:01:40.02
or the ability to moderate comments,

44
00:01:40.02 --> 00:01:42.08
and that makes it easier
to manage a brand.

45
00:01:42.08 --> 00:01:46.00
I can't keep up on every single
thing that needs to happen,

46
00:01:46.00 --> 00:01:48.04
nor do I want to be a bottleneck
every time somebody needs

47
00:01:48.04 --> 00:01:51.01
to use a video or upload something.

48
00:01:51.01 --> 00:01:52.05
So, this makes it a lot easier

49
00:01:52.05 --> 00:01:56.08
for multiple people to
have access and control.

50
00:01:56.08 --> 00:01:59.05
I also like that this gives
you the ability to monetize,

51
00:01:59.05 --> 00:02:02.08
and this can be done
through the partner program.

52
00:02:02.08 --> 00:02:04.01
Now, this monetization means

53
00:02:04.01 --> 00:02:06.00
that YouTube is going to serve up ads

54
00:02:06.00 --> 00:02:08.00
that it thinks are
relevant to your content.

55
00:02:08.00 --> 00:02:10.05
And we'll talk more
about advertising later.

56
00:02:10.05 --> 00:02:12.07
However, it also means that you are able

57
00:02:12.07 --> 00:02:14.08
to link to your own website,

58
00:02:14.08 --> 00:02:17.03
and I have found that
this makes it possible

59
00:02:17.03 --> 00:02:19.06
to link to products
that you have for sale,

60
00:02:19.06 --> 00:02:22.06
or to use this to trigger
links for affiliate products

61
00:02:22.06 --> 00:02:24.09
that you also promote on your website.

62
00:02:24.09 --> 00:02:27.00
This really opens up
a lot of great options

63
00:02:27.00 --> 00:02:31.00
so you can monetize your
content in more than one way.

64
00:02:31.00 --> 00:02:35.01
And, by using playlist, content
is a lot easier to discover.

65
00:02:35.01 --> 00:02:37.04
Rather than YouTube just serving up

66
00:02:37.04 --> 00:02:39.01
video after video on a topic,

67
00:02:39.01 --> 00:02:42.00
you can actually decide
what is shown to people,

68
00:02:42.00 --> 00:02:44.09
and those playlists can even
be embedded on a website,

69
00:02:44.09 --> 00:02:47.04
making it easier for
people to watch the content

70
00:02:47.04 --> 00:02:50.09
on your website or in another location.

71
00:02:50.09 --> 00:02:53.07
There are some potential
drawbacks to having a channel,

72
00:02:53.07 --> 00:02:56.00
and it really comes down
to two simple problems.

73
00:02:56.00 --> 00:02:59.00
First up, this is one more social network

74
00:02:59.00 --> 00:03:00.08
that you're going to have to manage.

75
00:03:00.08 --> 00:03:03.08
And, one of the things that I
find frustrating about Google

76
00:03:03.08 --> 00:03:05.08
is that they always change things.

77
00:03:05.08 --> 00:03:07.06
The artwork requirements change.

78
00:03:07.06 --> 00:03:10.04
Features that you have suddenly go away.

79
00:03:10.04 --> 00:03:12.01
The requirements to be a member

80
00:03:12.01 --> 00:03:13.03
of the YouTube partner program

81
00:03:13.03 --> 00:03:15.00
dramatically changed recently,

82
00:03:15.00 --> 00:03:17.07
pushing a lot of people
out of the program.

83
00:03:17.07 --> 00:03:19.04
So, you have to be careful,

84
00:03:19.04 --> 00:03:22.02
and you can't put all of
your eggs in one basket.

85
00:03:22.02 --> 00:03:25.07
Additionally, YouTube has
a lot of copyright issues

86
00:03:25.07 --> 00:03:27.00
that you need to be aware of,

87
00:03:27.00 --> 00:03:28.05
and we'll talk about those more later

88
00:03:28.05 --> 00:03:30.04
when we look at Terms of Service.

89
00:03:30.04 --> 00:03:32.03
The other problem to be mindful of

90
00:03:32.03 --> 00:03:35.03
is that this is one more
set of messages to track.

91
00:03:35.03 --> 00:03:38.00
You're going to get additional
comments from people

92
00:03:38.00 --> 00:03:40.09
that you might need to
moderate or reply to.

93
00:03:40.09 --> 00:03:42.09
You're going to get people
who use rude language

94
00:03:42.09 --> 00:03:44.06
that might need a response.

95
00:03:44.06 --> 00:03:47.05
And, you'll find that there
are so many different places

96
00:03:47.05 --> 00:03:50.01
where people can send you a
message or leave a comment,

97
00:03:50.01 --> 00:03:52.05
from your entire channel
to a specific video

98
00:03:52.05 --> 00:03:55.01
to a playlist to your Google Plus profile,

99
00:03:55.01 --> 00:03:58.02
that all of a sudden you're
missing opportunities here

100
00:03:58.02 --> 00:04:01.03
for business or for
customer service needs.

101
00:04:01.03 --> 00:04:04.06
So it's important that you have
somebody in charge of this,

102
00:04:04.06 --> 00:04:06.08
and you pay attention to your channel.

103
00:04:06.08 --> 00:04:09.05
Now, this just means that
there's more work to do,

104
00:04:09.05 --> 00:04:11.07
but I generally find that the risks

105
00:04:11.07 --> 00:04:14.08
and the negative parts of having a channel

106
00:04:14.08 --> 00:04:16.09
are outweighed by the positive aspects,

107
00:04:16.09 --> 00:04:19.03
but do keep in mind that
this is something else

108
00:04:19.03 --> 00:04:21.00
that needs to be maintained and run,

109
00:04:21.00 --> 00:04:23.06
and that somebody needs
to be in charge of it.

110
00:04:23.06 --> 00:04:26.01
As such, while it's relatively simple

111
00:04:26.01 --> 00:04:27.07
to put a YouTube channel together,

112
00:04:27.07 --> 00:04:29.05
there are many different components,

113
00:04:29.05 --> 00:04:32.07
and lots of different
interconnected services.

114
00:04:32.07 --> 00:04:34.06
Wanna take advantage of advertising?

115
00:04:34.06 --> 00:04:36.01
Well, you have to take advantage

116
00:04:36.01 --> 00:04:37.07
of setting up Google AdWords.

117
00:04:37.07 --> 00:04:39.07
Wanna make sure you're monetizing things?

118
00:04:39.07 --> 00:04:42.01
Well, then you need to start
setting up different accounts,

119
00:04:42.01 --> 00:04:45.01
and all of a sudden,
it becomes a whole mesh

120
00:04:45.01 --> 00:04:47.04
of Google Analytics plus artwork

121
00:04:47.04 --> 00:04:49.03
plus third party applications.

122
00:04:49.03 --> 00:04:52.06
So, while just posting a video
to YouTube is pretty easy,

123
00:04:52.06 --> 00:04:55.06
setting up and maintaining
a channel is not,

124
00:04:55.06 --> 00:04:59.01
and that's why this course
has so much detail in it.
