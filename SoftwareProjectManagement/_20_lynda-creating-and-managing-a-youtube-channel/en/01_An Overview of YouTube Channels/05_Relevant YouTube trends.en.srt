1
00:00:00.05 --> 00:00:02.06
- Before we start getting
into some specifics,

2
00:00:02.06 --> 00:00:05.07
let me provide a little bit
of motivation in context.

3
00:00:05.07 --> 00:00:08.03
Just how, exactly, is YouTube doing?

4
00:00:08.03 --> 00:00:10.05
Well, I took a snapshot of some statistics

5
00:00:10.05 --> 00:00:12.06
at the time of the
recording of this class.

6
00:00:12.06 --> 00:00:13.08
And I'll tell you this much.

7
00:00:13.08 --> 00:00:15.02
YouTube is still growing,

8
00:00:15.02 --> 00:00:18.05
so chances are these numbers
are just going to keep going up.

9
00:00:18.05 --> 00:00:20.01
Some relevant things to keep in mind,

10
00:00:20.01 --> 00:00:25.07
YouTube has about 1.5 billion
logged-in monthly users.

11
00:00:25.07 --> 00:00:27.01
That's a lot of people.

12
00:00:27.01 --> 00:00:31.01
1 1/2 billion people log
in to YouTube each month.

13
00:00:31.01 --> 00:00:33.06
This breaks down to
about 180 million users

14
00:00:33.06 --> 00:00:37.02
in the United States, but in
other more populated countries,

15
00:00:37.02 --> 00:00:41.02
for example, India, there's
400 million people watching.

16
00:00:41.02 --> 00:00:43.06
Do keep in mind that services like YouTube

17
00:00:43.06 --> 00:00:46.02
are officially blocked inside of China.

18
00:00:46.02 --> 00:00:48.07
Otherwise, these numbers
would be even bigger.

19
00:00:48.07 --> 00:00:51.03
Now, some folks within
China might access YouTube

20
00:00:51.03 --> 00:00:54.09
through a VPN, but officially,
YouTube is not authorized

21
00:00:54.09 --> 00:00:56.08
to be in certain countries.

22
00:00:56.08 --> 00:00:58.07
Now, of those 1 1/2 billion people

23
00:00:58.07 --> 00:01:00.08
that log in on a monthly basis,

24
00:01:00.08 --> 00:01:03.03
that translates into a lot of views.

25
00:01:03.03 --> 00:01:05.06
In fact, members of Generation X

26
00:01:05.06 --> 00:01:09.00
log 1 1/2 billion views a day on YouTube.

27
00:01:09.00 --> 00:01:11.03
That's a lot of content.

28
00:01:11.03 --> 00:01:15.08
In fact, each day people
watch a billion hours

29
00:01:15.08 --> 00:01:17.07
of video on YouTube.

30
00:01:17.07 --> 00:01:22.09
Every single day a billion
hours of content is consumed.

31
00:01:22.09 --> 00:01:26.07
That's a lot of bandwidth, a
lot of potentially wasted time,

32
00:01:26.07 --> 00:01:31.00
but a lot of entertainment,
education, and news as well.

33
00:01:31.00 --> 00:01:34.07
YouTube is currently offered
in 76 different languages,

34
00:01:34.07 --> 00:01:37.04
which covers approximately 95%

35
00:01:37.04 --> 00:01:39.09
of the world's internet population.

36
00:01:39.09 --> 00:01:42.06
The fact that so many different
languages are available

37
00:01:42.06 --> 00:01:46.00
makes it easy for people
to discover local content

38
00:01:46.00 --> 00:01:48.04
using a localized UI.

39
00:01:48.04 --> 00:01:51.07
And even for content that they
might not be familiar with,

40
00:01:51.07 --> 00:01:55.00
oftentimes people will produce
captions in other languages

41
00:01:55.00 --> 00:01:59.04
and allow you to embed
those into your video.

42
00:01:59.04 --> 00:02:01.09
Additionally, YouTube has been localized

43
00:02:01.09 --> 00:02:04.07
for 88 different countries currently,

44
00:02:04.07 --> 00:02:07.03
which means that almost
every country on the planet

45
00:02:07.03 --> 00:02:09.02
can access it.

46
00:02:09.02 --> 00:02:11.08
Couple other statistics to keep in mind,

47
00:02:11.08 --> 00:02:17.03
91% of US internet users,
aged 13 to 17, are using it.

48
00:02:17.03 --> 00:02:20.01
So the teenage population
of the United States

49
00:02:20.01 --> 00:02:23.00
is on YouTube, a lot, in fact.

50
00:02:23.00 --> 00:02:26.03
About 81% of millennials use YouTube.

51
00:02:26.03 --> 00:02:29.02
And as we keep going up you'll
see that it drops a bit,

52
00:02:29.02 --> 00:02:33.06
with about 58% of Generation
X in the United States.

53
00:02:33.06 --> 00:02:36.01
And about 43% of all baby boomers

54
00:02:36.01 --> 00:02:38.02
in the United States use YouTube.

55
00:02:38.02 --> 00:02:41.04
Why use YouTube and take the
time to set up a channel?

56
00:02:41.04 --> 00:02:44.04
Well, truth is you're going
to reach a lot of people.

57
00:02:44.04 --> 00:02:48.00
So while there are some hassles
and some potential drawbacks

58
00:02:48.00 --> 00:02:50.03
tied to the rights to your content,

59
00:02:50.03 --> 00:02:53.09
YouTube is the easiest way to
reach a worldwide audience.

60
00:02:53.09 --> 00:02:56.06
And as such, it means
that if you take the time

61
00:02:56.06 --> 00:02:58.09
to do it right, you
can hit a lot of people

62
00:02:58.09 --> 00:03:01.07
with your content and
reach a lot of eyeballs.
