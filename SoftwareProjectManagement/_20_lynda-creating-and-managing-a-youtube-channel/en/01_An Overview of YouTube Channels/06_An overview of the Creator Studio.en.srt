1
00:00:00.04 --> 00:00:01.08
- There's a key area

2
00:00:01.08 --> 00:00:04.06
where you will control
your YouTube content

3
00:00:04.06 --> 00:00:06.03
as a YouTube creator

4
00:00:06.03 --> 00:00:09.03
and it's often referred
to as the Creator Studio.

5
00:00:09.03 --> 00:00:12.01
This is a suite of tools
that gives you access

6
00:00:12.01 --> 00:00:14.06
to different controls over your content

7
00:00:14.06 --> 00:00:17.03
and different ways to
manage it, analyze it,

8
00:00:17.03 --> 00:00:19.01
and engage others.

9
00:00:19.01 --> 00:00:22.00
Now currently, YouTube
has been in a beta process

10
00:00:22.00 --> 00:00:24.06
of rolling out a new Creator Studio.

11
00:00:24.06 --> 00:00:26.03
And at the time of this recording,

12
00:00:26.03 --> 00:00:28.04
they have not yet fully implemented it.

13
00:00:28.04 --> 00:00:30.03
It's only about half done.

14
00:00:30.03 --> 00:00:33.05
I'd like to show you each for
a moment and help you realize

15
00:00:33.05 --> 00:00:36.03
that you're going to be using
both versions for a while

16
00:00:36.03 --> 00:00:39.05
and even after the beta version
becomes the new version,

17
00:00:39.05 --> 00:00:41.01
there's a good chance that YouTube

18
00:00:41.01 --> 00:00:42.04
will keep the other one around

19
00:00:42.04 --> 00:00:44.02
because people know how to use it.

20
00:00:44.02 --> 00:00:47.00
So let's show you what these
look like at a high level.

21
00:00:47.00 --> 00:00:50.09
The current YouTube Studio
is a simple dashboard

22
00:00:50.09 --> 00:00:53.03
and if you're logged in
to your YouTube account

23
00:00:53.03 --> 00:00:58.01
and you visit youtube.com/dashboard,
you'll see this.

24
00:00:58.01 --> 00:01:00.04
However, there's a very different version

25
00:01:00.04 --> 00:01:01.09
that's the beta version

26
00:01:01.09 --> 00:01:05.01
and this version only works
with Google Chrome currently

27
00:01:05.01 --> 00:01:08.07
and this is the Studio version
that has similar controls

28
00:01:08.07 --> 00:01:11.00
but many things are missing.

29
00:01:11.00 --> 00:01:13.00
Well, let's take a look at that first one.

30
00:01:13.00 --> 00:01:16.01
Let me switch to one of my
accounts that's populated.

31
00:01:16.01 --> 00:01:18.07
Your account may have
nothing in it like this one

32
00:01:18.07 --> 00:01:20.07
when you first start.

33
00:01:20.07 --> 00:01:22.06
When I switch to another account,

34
00:01:22.06 --> 00:01:24.08
you'll see that I have
the ability to choose

35
00:01:24.08 --> 00:01:26.08
how I want to use YouTube

36
00:01:26.08 --> 00:01:29.04
and I'm going to select as
Photo Focus in this case.

37
00:01:29.04 --> 00:01:31.08
But again, only I have access to this.

38
00:01:31.08 --> 00:01:33.05
You would not.

39
00:01:33.05 --> 00:01:35.01
This is the classic version

40
00:01:35.01 --> 00:01:37.06
and you'll see that on the dashboard here,

41
00:01:37.06 --> 00:01:39.03
I get some useful tools.

42
00:01:39.03 --> 00:01:41.08
I have the ability to see different videos

43
00:01:41.08 --> 00:01:44.01
and these are two
playlists that I've setup,

44
00:01:44.01 --> 00:01:46.07
the ability to see my published videos

45
00:01:46.07 --> 00:01:49.03
and the ability to see
all of my private videos

46
00:01:49.03 --> 00:01:51.03
that have not yet been published.

47
00:01:51.03 --> 00:01:55.01
I can click view all to switch
to seeing all of the videos.

48
00:01:55.01 --> 00:01:58.05
On the right here I have some
basic analytics and details

49
00:01:58.05 --> 00:02:01.05
and they'll provide some
additional information to me here

50
00:02:01.05 --> 00:02:05.01
with ads about other changes
that Google has published

51
00:02:05.01 --> 00:02:08.05
that might affect me as a YouTube creator.

52
00:02:08.05 --> 00:02:10.08
Now you can see recent
comments from people

53
00:02:10.08 --> 00:02:13.07
and these are comments
across multiple videos.

54
00:02:13.07 --> 00:02:16.03
So instead of having to go video to video,

55
00:02:16.03 --> 00:02:17.09
you can see all of your comments

56
00:02:17.09 --> 00:02:21.03
and reply to them from your audience.

57
00:02:21.03 --> 00:02:24.03
On the left-hand side,
there are different tools

58
00:02:24.03 --> 00:02:26.05
and I'm not going to go
through all of these now,

59
00:02:26.05 --> 00:02:28.05
but we will explore them in depth.

60
00:02:28.05 --> 00:02:30.01
Essentially, it's the ability

61
00:02:30.01 --> 00:02:32.07
to see an overview of the dashboard,

62
00:02:32.07 --> 00:02:37.04
the ability to see all of your
videos in the video manager,

63
00:02:37.04 --> 00:02:41.05
live streaming to put on
webinars and live events,

64
00:02:41.05 --> 00:02:44.04
community to engage with your audience,

65
00:02:44.04 --> 00:02:47.09
controls over how your
channel is presented,

66
00:02:47.09 --> 00:02:50.02
the ability to learn about your audience

67
00:02:50.02 --> 00:02:51.05
and their consumption,

68
00:02:51.05 --> 00:02:53.07
the ability to see language translations

69
00:02:53.07 --> 00:02:56.07
as well as transcripts for a video,

70
00:02:56.07 --> 00:03:01.07
and the ability to create
additional content.

71
00:03:01.07 --> 00:03:02.07
If you click on one of these,

72
00:03:02.07 --> 00:03:05.00
you'll see that it starts to expand.

73
00:03:05.00 --> 00:03:08.01
For example, YouTube has
an audio library here

74
00:03:08.01 --> 00:03:12.01
and policies about how you can use music.

75
00:03:12.01 --> 00:03:15.05
And you can also lastly
see your contributions.

76
00:03:15.05 --> 00:03:17.05
If you want to see the beta studio,

77
00:03:17.05 --> 00:03:20.07
you can click here on YouTube Studio Beta.

78
00:03:20.07 --> 00:03:23.02
However, as you see here,
it's going to warn you

79
00:03:23.02 --> 00:03:26.01
that it only works with
certain web browsers.

80
00:03:26.01 --> 00:03:30.00
The best experience is going
to be on Google's own Chrome.

81
00:03:30.00 --> 00:03:31.09
Let's go ahead and switch
over to Chrome for a moment

82
00:03:31.09 --> 00:03:35.01
so you can see this and you'll
see a dramatically different

83
00:03:35.01 --> 00:03:37.08
more modern user interface.

84
00:03:37.08 --> 00:03:41.00
However, there are many things missing.

85
00:03:41.00 --> 00:03:44.08
Right now, we only have
access to our video library,

86
00:03:44.08 --> 00:03:49.04
analytics or information about
the library, and comments.

87
00:03:49.04 --> 00:03:51.04
If I come down here to missing features,

88
00:03:51.04 --> 00:03:54.02
you'll see that there are
quite a few other choices

89
00:03:54.02 --> 00:03:55.08
that are still missing.

90
00:03:55.08 --> 00:03:57.07
For example, if you
want to make a playlist,

91
00:03:57.07 --> 00:03:59.03
well when you click that,

92
00:03:59.03 --> 00:04:00.08
it's going to open a new tab

93
00:04:00.08 --> 00:04:04.00
and take you back to
the old user interface.

94
00:04:04.00 --> 00:04:06.08
As such, we're not going
to spend as much time here

95
00:04:06.08 --> 00:04:08.06
on the new user interface,

96
00:04:08.06 --> 00:04:10.05
but I will say that eventually,

97
00:04:10.05 --> 00:04:14.03
this is where things are going
and as you log in to YouTube,

98
00:04:14.03 --> 00:04:17.00
you may see one or the other.

99
00:04:17.00 --> 00:04:19.08
You will see at the bottom
here that you have the ability

100
00:04:19.08 --> 00:04:23.05
to use what they refer to
as Creator Studio Classic

101
00:04:23.05 --> 00:04:26.09
or to use the new
YouTube Studio interface.

102
00:04:26.09 --> 00:04:29.05
Right now though, this
is very much in beta

103
00:04:29.05 --> 00:04:32.08
and many of the features and
functionality are missing.

104
00:04:32.08 --> 00:04:35.03
However, this beta has
been going on currently

105
00:04:35.03 --> 00:04:36.09
for almost a year and a half

106
00:04:36.09 --> 00:04:39.06
and will likely continue for some time.

107
00:04:39.06 --> 00:04:43.02
YouTube is a sizeable website
with hundreds of features

108
00:04:43.02 --> 00:04:46.06
so making the migration is
going to take some time.

109
00:04:46.06 --> 00:04:48.07
Where relevant, I'll make sure to show you

110
00:04:48.07 --> 00:04:52.00
both user interfaces,
but just remember this.

111
00:04:52.00 --> 00:04:55.02
The general functionality
is going to be the same.

112
00:04:55.02 --> 00:04:57.06
So if you know that
it's called a playlist,

113
00:04:57.06 --> 00:04:59.00
you can look for playlist

114
00:04:59.00 --> 00:05:01.02
and while the button
might have moved slightly

115
00:05:01.02 --> 00:05:04.03
or something that you used
this week can be gone next,

116
00:05:04.03 --> 00:05:07.09
just realize that the general
concepts stay the same.

117
00:05:07.09 --> 00:05:09.07
So what you're going to use in this course

118
00:05:09.07 --> 00:05:12.04
and what you're going to
learn is going to be relevant

119
00:05:12.04 --> 00:05:15.00
and really stay the course

120
00:05:15.00 --> 00:05:17.09
as you start to build
out your Google Library.

121
00:05:17.09 --> 00:05:19.07
As you build out that YouTube channel,

122
00:05:19.07 --> 00:05:22.03
what you'll see is that the exact buttons

123
00:05:22.03 --> 00:05:25.05
and tools that you use may change slightly

124
00:05:25.05 --> 00:05:27.05
and it might move from the left column

125
00:05:27.05 --> 00:05:30.05
to the upper right
corner to a dialogue box,

126
00:05:30.05 --> 00:05:32.07
but as long as you know what to look for

127
00:05:32.07 --> 00:05:34.09
and you're not above
clicking the help menu,

128
00:05:34.09 --> 00:05:38.00
you will find where
Google moved the cheese.

129
00:05:38.00 --> 00:05:40.03
All right, let's continue
and start to look

130
00:05:40.03 --> 00:05:43.00
at some of the specific tools
that you'll need to use.
