1
00:00:00.07 --> 00:00:03.00
- Now that you have a
destination ready to receive it,

2
00:00:03.00 --> 00:00:05.05
let's talk about uploading video files.

3
00:00:05.05 --> 00:00:08.04
There are many different
video formats out there,

4
00:00:08.04 --> 00:00:10.03
and it's important that
you know which ones

5
00:00:10.03 --> 00:00:13.02
work with YouTube, and
which ones work well.

6
00:00:13.02 --> 00:00:15.02
A couple things to keep in mind.

7
00:00:15.02 --> 00:00:17.03
That there are many different formats

8
00:00:17.03 --> 00:00:19.04
that YouTube will support.

9
00:00:19.04 --> 00:00:22.05
That's because many different
applications create videos

10
00:00:22.05 --> 00:00:23.06
in different ways.

11
00:00:23.06 --> 00:00:27.08
You have formats like MOV and
MPEG4 that are very common,

12
00:00:27.08 --> 00:00:31.02
and MP4 is just another variation of that.

13
00:00:31.02 --> 00:00:34.07
Or the newer HEVC, the
high-efficiency video codec

14
00:00:34.07 --> 00:00:40.01
which is h.265, which the
next generation of MPEG4.

15
00:00:40.01 --> 00:00:43.05
There are older formats,
like AVI and Windows Media,

16
00:00:43.05 --> 00:00:45.05
as well as the Flash video format.

17
00:00:45.05 --> 00:00:48.06
And these are formats
that are not very popular.

18
00:00:48.06 --> 00:00:50.03
You've also got professional formats

19
00:00:50.03 --> 00:00:53.09
like DNxHR from Avid and ProRes from Apple

20
00:00:53.09 --> 00:00:57.05
and CineForm from GoPro,
also used by Adobe.

21
00:00:57.05 --> 00:01:00.04
But at the end of the day, what
you really need to consider

22
00:01:00.04 --> 00:01:07.02
is that uploading a high-quality
MPEG4, MP4, or h.265 file

23
00:01:07.02 --> 00:01:09.04
will give you some of the best results.

24
00:01:09.04 --> 00:01:12.01
That's because these are
the files that are optimized

25
00:01:12.01 --> 00:01:13.08
and ready for upload.

26
00:01:13.08 --> 00:01:15.01
So you want to make sure

27
00:01:15.01 --> 00:01:18.02
that you're having to do a
whole lot of recompression

28
00:01:18.02 --> 00:01:20.05
or extra thought about the file.

29
00:01:20.05 --> 00:01:22.01
Now if you have the bandwidth,

30
00:01:22.01 --> 00:01:24.08
and you want to upload
the ultimate-quality file,

31
00:01:24.08 --> 00:01:28.09
things like a ProRes
movie or a CineForm movie

32
00:01:28.09 --> 00:01:30.05
will go a long way

33
00:01:30.05 --> 00:01:32.09
and you can actually use
those professional assets

34
00:01:32.09 --> 00:01:36.00
and let YouTube make all
of the encoding versions

35
00:01:36.00 --> 00:01:37.08
for the different bandwidths and streams.

36
00:01:37.08 --> 00:01:40.01
Other things to think about
is that it needs to be

37
00:01:40.01 --> 00:01:41.06
progressive scan.

38
00:01:41.06 --> 00:01:43.08
This means no interlaced video.

39
00:01:43.08 --> 00:01:45.08
If you do have interlaced content,

40
00:01:45.08 --> 00:01:50.02
the content should be deinterlaced
when you do the encode.

41
00:01:50.02 --> 00:01:52.08
Ideally, if you're shooting
video specifically for the web

42
00:01:52.08 --> 00:01:55.02
or YouTube, you would
turn interlacing off.

43
00:01:55.02 --> 00:01:57.04
Other things to think about
is that if that material

44
00:01:57.04 --> 00:02:01.02
starts off as interlaced, such as 1081i60,

45
00:02:01.02 --> 00:02:03.04
well, you're going to end
up deinterlacing that,

46
00:02:03.04 --> 00:02:06.07
taking it to 1080p, 30 frames per second.

47
00:02:06.07 --> 00:02:09.05
Now this is not mandatory,

48
00:02:09.05 --> 00:02:12.01
but you will get
substantially better results

49
00:02:12.01 --> 00:02:15.01
if you do this conversion
on your local machine

50
00:02:15.01 --> 00:02:18.04
before you upload to YouTube.

51
00:02:18.04 --> 00:02:21.05
Other things to think about
are the general aspect ratio.

52
00:02:21.05 --> 00:02:25.01
Most versions of YouTube are
going to use a 16 by nine

53
00:02:25.01 --> 00:02:27.00
aspect ratio player.

54
00:02:27.00 --> 00:02:28.08
This means that if you put up a video

55
00:02:28.08 --> 00:02:32.02
that's not 16 by nine, it's
going to get processed,

56
00:02:32.02 --> 00:02:34.02
and there'll typically be black bars

57
00:02:34.02 --> 00:02:35.09
either on the left or right.

58
00:02:35.09 --> 00:02:37.09
This is referred to as pillarboxing

59
00:02:37.09 --> 00:02:39.07
because of the vertical bars,

60
00:02:39.07 --> 00:02:43.02
or if it has an aspect
ratio that's widescreen,

61
00:02:43.02 --> 00:02:46.03
but maybe more cinematic, well,
then it'll be letterboxed,

62
00:02:46.03 --> 00:02:49.02
with black bars on the top and bottom.

63
00:02:49.02 --> 00:02:52.08
Now if you are on a mobile
device, such as iOS devices,

64
00:02:52.08 --> 00:02:56.03
it is possible that
vertical video can work.

65
00:02:56.03 --> 00:02:58.02
That's because a lot of folks are shooting

66
00:02:58.02 --> 00:03:00.01
and streaming vertical video,

67
00:03:00.01 --> 00:03:03.05
and they're experimenting with
this on the mobile platform.

68
00:03:03.05 --> 00:03:05.06
So if you do have mobile content

69
00:03:05.06 --> 00:03:08.03
or you're doing a mobile
stream vertically,

70
00:03:08.03 --> 00:03:10.07
it is possible that that can show up,

71
00:03:10.07 --> 00:03:12.03
but this is really being targeted

72
00:03:12.03 --> 00:03:14.04
to mobile devices this way.

73
00:03:14.04 --> 00:03:17.01
Now, as far as the overall quality,

74
00:03:17.01 --> 00:03:20.02
YouTube supports pretty
much every known recognized

75
00:03:20.02 --> 00:03:21.06
video resolution.

76
00:03:21.06 --> 00:03:23.09
And as you can see here,
there's a whole bunch.

77
00:03:23.09 --> 00:03:27.04
You can go all the way up to
4K or Ultra High Definition,

78
00:03:27.04 --> 00:03:30.01
which is the 2160p.

79
00:03:30.01 --> 00:03:33.04
Below that, 1440p tends
to be a common resolution

80
00:03:33.04 --> 00:03:35.04
used for screencasting.

81
00:03:35.04 --> 00:03:38.05
And you'll see the very
standard high-definition sizes

82
00:03:38.05 --> 00:03:41.03
of 1080p and 720p.

83
00:03:41.03 --> 00:03:44.05
The other sizes you see there
are standard definition,

84
00:03:44.05 --> 00:03:46.03
generally not a good idea.

85
00:03:46.03 --> 00:03:50.01
Now YouTube will make lower-res
versions for mobile devices

86
00:03:50.01 --> 00:03:53.05
and low bandwidth situations,
but for the most part,

87
00:03:53.05 --> 00:03:55.00
it's an extremely good idea

88
00:03:55.00 --> 00:03:58.09
to upload high-definition
content or higher to YouTube

89
00:03:58.09 --> 00:04:02.08
so that people can enjoy
it on most modern devices.

90
00:04:02.08 --> 00:04:05.06
Now if you take a look,
there are not bitrates,

91
00:04:05.06 --> 00:04:07.07
and bitrate is a little bit confusing,

92
00:04:07.07 --> 00:04:10.09
but this deals with the
quality of the file.

93
00:04:10.09 --> 00:04:13.04
So you'll see here the ability to set this

94
00:04:13.04 --> 00:04:16.04
in megabits per second,
and what it comes down to

95
00:04:16.04 --> 00:04:19.05
is that the higher the frame size,

96
00:04:19.05 --> 00:04:21.04
the higher the data rate size.

97
00:04:21.04 --> 00:04:25.07
So 4K video really starts to
get pretty high data rate,

98
00:04:25.07 --> 00:04:28.05
and so it's important
that you put this up here.

99
00:04:28.05 --> 00:04:31.04
And what you see is for
your standard framerates,

100
00:04:31.04 --> 00:04:32.08
you're looking at anywhere

101
00:04:32.08 --> 00:04:36.02
from about 35 to 45 megabits a second,

102
00:04:36.02 --> 00:04:39.08
if you're dealing with 4K,
but that number almost doubles

103
00:04:39.08 --> 00:04:42.04
if you're gonna be delivering
with higher framerates.

104
00:04:42.04 --> 00:04:46.01
That's because more frames
per second is going to need

105
00:04:46.01 --> 00:04:47.04
more information.

106
00:04:47.04 --> 00:04:49.08
Now that's for standard dynamic range.

107
00:04:49.08 --> 00:04:52.05
YouTube does also support the newer,

108
00:04:52.05 --> 00:04:54.07
high-dynamic range video.

109
00:04:54.07 --> 00:04:56.04
This is more for delivery to things

110
00:04:56.04 --> 00:04:58.07
like high-dynamic range television sets,

111
00:04:58.07 --> 00:05:01.04
although we are starting
to see mobile devices

112
00:05:01.04 --> 00:05:03.05
having a wider gamut than traditionally,

113
00:05:03.05 --> 00:05:06.09
and more screens will move
towards this standard.

114
00:05:06.09 --> 00:05:09.08
If you have produced video
in high dynamic range color,

115
00:05:09.08 --> 00:05:13.02
very few of you will have,
but this is something that,

116
00:05:13.02 --> 00:05:17.01
content that's aired for
television or for produced films

117
00:05:17.01 --> 00:05:18.05
are starting to do, well,

118
00:05:18.05 --> 00:05:20.07
then the data rate requirements go up.

119
00:05:20.07 --> 00:05:23.01
As you can see here, it's
important that you have

120
00:05:23.01 --> 00:05:25.02
a little bit more extra information

121
00:05:25.02 --> 00:05:28.04
to accommodate the high
dynamic range video.

122
00:05:28.04 --> 00:05:31.09
So in this case, the
overall data rate does go up

123
00:05:31.09 --> 00:05:34.00
a little bit, by about 20 or 30%

124
00:05:34.00 --> 00:05:36.05
on each of these common sizes.

125
00:05:36.05 --> 00:05:38.06
Now that's a lot of specs,

126
00:05:38.06 --> 00:05:40.05
and I expect that you might
want to go back through

127
00:05:40.05 --> 00:05:42.08
and watch that video again to pause.

128
00:05:42.08 --> 00:05:46.01
If you upload video that
is below these specs,

129
00:05:46.01 --> 00:05:49.02
what you'll generally find
is that the quality suffers,

130
00:05:49.02 --> 00:05:51.00
particularly for the consumer.

131
00:05:51.00 --> 00:05:53.03
One of the things that
YouTube likes you to do

132
00:05:53.03 --> 00:05:56.02
is to upload a higher-quality file.

133
00:05:56.02 --> 00:05:59.01
This way, it can make
additional compressions

134
00:05:59.01 --> 00:06:02.07
for the smaller sizes
and lower-quality streams

135
00:06:02.07 --> 00:06:04.09
that it will serve up to mobile users

136
00:06:04.09 --> 00:06:07.05
or people on slower internet connections.

137
00:06:07.05 --> 00:06:09.00
If you don't start high,

138
00:06:09.00 --> 00:06:11.07
it's hard to make all of
those other sizes available,

139
00:06:11.07 --> 00:06:14.00
and it really drops in quality.

140
00:06:14.00 --> 00:06:16.03
And do keep in mind that
if you upload a video

141
00:06:16.03 --> 00:06:20.03
that's only HD, YouTube
won't upres the video to 4K.

142
00:06:20.03 --> 00:06:24.00
So if you want to take advantage
of those larger frame sizes

143
00:06:24.00 --> 00:06:26.08
and higher-quality delivery
methods, you need to start

144
00:06:26.08 --> 00:06:28.07
with a high-quality source.

145
00:06:28.07 --> 00:06:30.03
So go with the best you have,

146
00:06:30.03 --> 00:06:37.06
optimize it as a high-quality
h.264, h.265, or MPEG4 file,

147
00:06:37.06 --> 00:06:40.05
and you should be able to
upload this pretty easily.

148
00:06:40.05 --> 00:06:43.06
Most video-editing tools and
their compression software

149
00:06:43.06 --> 00:06:45.04
will also have presets built in

150
00:06:45.04 --> 00:06:47.09
to make this significantly easier.

151
00:06:47.09 --> 00:06:49.08
And if you need to learn
more about compression,

152
00:06:49.08 --> 00:06:53.00
we do have several courses
available in the online library.
