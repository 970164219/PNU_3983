1
00:00:00.05 --> 00:00:02.09
- Besides the basic
information about the video,

2
00:00:02.09 --> 00:00:04.08
there is an advanced settings tab

3
00:00:04.08 --> 00:00:07.03
that has a lot of useful controls.

4
00:00:07.03 --> 00:00:10.07
This will allow you to
change many properties.

5
00:00:10.07 --> 00:00:11.09
Now when you're uploading,

6
00:00:11.09 --> 00:00:13.07
you'll see this as another tab

7
00:00:13.07 --> 00:00:17.04
or you can access this by
going to the video manager.

8
00:00:17.04 --> 00:00:18.04
What it comes down to

9
00:00:18.04 --> 00:00:21.01
is choosing the settings
that matter to you.

10
00:00:21.01 --> 00:00:24.05
So you can decide to
allow comments or not.

11
00:00:24.05 --> 00:00:29.01
I generally choose to allow
only approved comments.

12
00:00:29.01 --> 00:00:32.06
You can also decide if you want
to allow videos to be rated.

13
00:00:32.06 --> 00:00:35.03
Now the ratings can be rated by the users

14
00:00:35.03 --> 00:00:37.08
so you can see what people
think of your content,

15
00:00:37.08 --> 00:00:40.08
but you can decide whether or
not you want to share those

16
00:00:40.08 --> 00:00:43.09
and let other people
see the average score.

17
00:00:43.09 --> 00:00:45.07
Now there's pros and cons here.

18
00:00:45.07 --> 00:00:49.04
Many people believe that
YouTube is a social platform

19
00:00:49.04 --> 00:00:52.01
and you want to let everybody see it.

20
00:00:52.01 --> 00:00:54.06
Other people feel like this
is more like television

21
00:00:54.06 --> 00:00:57.01
and why do we need to put the
reviews in front of people

22
00:00:57.01 --> 00:00:58.02
before they watch it.

23
00:00:58.02 --> 00:01:00.03
Let them make up their own mind.

24
00:01:00.03 --> 00:01:02.06
Well, it comes down to who
you're trying to target.

25
00:01:02.06 --> 00:01:05.06
Many people will decide
whether or not to watch a movie

26
00:01:05.06 --> 00:01:07.01
based upon the reviews

27
00:01:07.01 --> 00:01:08.09
and this is why scores
like Rotten Tomatoes

28
00:01:08.09 --> 00:01:10.08
and others have become popular,

29
00:01:10.08 --> 00:01:13.05
but there is something to
be said of not giving people

30
00:01:13.05 --> 00:01:17.09
too many opportunities for
feedback so you need to decide.

31
00:01:17.09 --> 00:01:21.03
Additionally, you can assign
the license and rights.

32
00:01:21.03 --> 00:01:23.01
There is the Standard YouTube License

33
00:01:23.01 --> 00:01:24.06
which we'll talk more about later

34
00:01:24.06 --> 00:01:28.02
that gives people the ability
to often reshare your content

35
00:01:28.02 --> 00:01:31.07
or you can specify the
Creative Comments License.

36
00:01:31.07 --> 00:01:33.04
If you're interested in Creative Comments,

37
00:01:33.04 --> 00:01:35.07
be sure to visit their
website to learn more

38
00:01:35.07 --> 00:01:38.04
about how the system works.

39
00:01:38.04 --> 00:01:41.01
Other settings that you can
choose include the ability

40
00:01:41.01 --> 00:01:44.06
to certify information about the captions.

41
00:01:44.06 --> 00:01:47.07
So if this is content that's
already aired on television,

42
00:01:47.07 --> 00:01:49.04
particularly the US market,

43
00:01:49.04 --> 00:01:52.08
well then you might actually
be subject to regulations

44
00:01:52.08 --> 00:01:55.02
and so you might be asked
to provide information

45
00:01:55.02 --> 00:01:59.06
about the captions if this
material has them or does not.

46
00:01:59.06 --> 00:02:02.08
Also, you can decide
how the video is allowed

47
00:02:02.08 --> 00:02:04.04
to be redistributed.

48
00:02:04.04 --> 00:02:06.02
Is embedding allowed?

49
00:02:06.02 --> 00:02:09.01
Do you want to make sure
that your subscribers know

50
00:02:09.01 --> 00:02:10.04
that the video went up?

51
00:02:10.04 --> 00:02:12.04
So this is pretty important.

52
00:02:12.04 --> 00:02:16.00
Additionally, make sure you
take a look at age restrictions.

53
00:02:16.00 --> 00:02:18.06
If you are concerned
about who can access this,

54
00:02:18.06 --> 00:02:21.05
you can actually set
a restriction for age.

55
00:02:21.05 --> 00:02:24.08
This means that only people
over the age of 18 can view it.

56
00:02:24.08 --> 00:02:27.03
You can also assign a category.

57
00:02:27.03 --> 00:02:29.04
Now I find categories frustrating

58
00:02:29.04 --> 00:02:32.06
because YouTube's category
system is very limiting

59
00:02:32.06 --> 00:02:35.09
and a lot of videos don't
cleanly fit into a category,

60
00:02:35.09 --> 00:02:39.00
but trying to make the best
match is going to help you

61
00:02:39.00 --> 00:02:40.04
get the broader audience

62
00:02:40.04 --> 00:02:42.02
and will help suggest your video

63
00:02:42.02 --> 00:02:44.05
when people are watching
particular genres.

64
00:02:44.05 --> 00:02:46.02
I really think that the categories

65
00:02:46.02 --> 00:02:48.02
need to be revisited by YouTube.

66
00:02:48.02 --> 00:02:52.02
The only system worse than
YouTube's is Apple's Podcast.

67
00:02:52.02 --> 00:02:54.08
They really have not kept
up with the type of content

68
00:02:54.08 --> 00:02:57.01
that's frequently published.

69
00:02:57.01 --> 00:02:59.03
Additionally, think about
if you want to allow

70
00:02:59.03 --> 00:03:00.08
community contributions.

71
00:03:00.08 --> 00:03:03.03
This can allow other
people to upload captions

72
00:03:03.03 --> 00:03:05.05
or other things to it

73
00:03:05.05 --> 00:03:08.03
and do you want to see any statistics.

74
00:03:08.03 --> 00:03:13.06
Can the public see
these stats or only you?

75
00:03:13.06 --> 00:03:16.06
Additionally, you can
tag relevant information

76
00:03:16.06 --> 00:03:18.09
such as where was the video captured,

77
00:03:18.09 --> 00:03:20.08
what was the date it was captured in,

78
00:03:20.08 --> 00:03:23.08
is it 3D and what's the language.

79
00:03:23.08 --> 00:03:25.08
Choosing the language is very important

80
00:03:25.08 --> 00:03:28.02
because this will help
generate the auto captions

81
00:03:28.02 --> 00:03:31.01
that YouTube will create to
make your video more accessible.

82
00:03:31.01 --> 00:03:33.03
We'll talk more about
those a little bit later.

83
00:03:33.03 --> 00:03:35.02
And if the video is 3D,

84
00:03:35.02 --> 00:03:37.04
YouTube does support 3D content

85
00:03:37.04 --> 00:03:39.06
so you can upload that
and people can watch it

86
00:03:39.06 --> 00:03:44.00
with special glasses or viewers.

87
00:03:44.00 --> 00:03:47.05
Lastly, make sure you
identify if the video contains

88
00:03:47.05 --> 00:03:52.01
any sponsored paid placement
and this is very important.

89
00:03:52.01 --> 00:03:54.03
YouTube got itself into a bit of trouble

90
00:03:54.03 --> 00:03:56.00
as well as blogging in general

91
00:03:56.00 --> 00:03:57.09
where people were
getting paid by companies

92
00:03:57.09 --> 00:04:00.03
to pitch products and talk about them.

93
00:04:00.03 --> 00:04:02.09
So if I were going to in this video

94
00:04:02.09 --> 00:04:05.01
talk to you about how
much I love this remote

95
00:04:05.01 --> 00:04:06.04
and why it was awesome,

96
00:04:06.04 --> 00:04:08.03
well if the company that made it

97
00:04:08.03 --> 00:04:11.03
actually paid me to do
that, I needed to tell you.

98
00:04:11.03 --> 00:04:13.09
Now if I generally like
something or I bought it myself,

99
00:04:13.09 --> 00:04:15.04
I don't have to tell you about it

100
00:04:15.04 --> 00:04:18.05
and say that I was paid to
give you this information,

101
00:04:18.05 --> 00:04:22.00
but those hosts or those making
videos that have products

102
00:04:22.00 --> 00:04:24.08
that had been given to them
for promotional purposes

103
00:04:24.08 --> 00:04:27.04
or they've been paid to talk about them,

104
00:04:27.04 --> 00:04:29.06
well they're asked to disclose that here

105
00:04:29.06 --> 00:04:34.02
so that is in the system and
not hidden from the public.

106
00:04:34.02 --> 00:04:36.04
Remember, if you are on a video

107
00:04:36.04 --> 00:04:39.00
and you want to modify
it and you're logged in,

108
00:04:39.00 --> 00:04:40.08
you can get those same controls

109
00:04:40.08 --> 00:04:43.08
for the advanced area under edit video.

110
00:04:43.08 --> 00:04:45.09
Just scroll down and
these are very similar

111
00:04:45.09 --> 00:04:50.00
to the upload controls and
go to the advanced settings.

112
00:04:50.00 --> 00:04:52.07
All of the different areas
we talked about are here.

113
00:04:52.07 --> 00:04:57.07
So for example, I can say
show only approved comments

114
00:04:57.07 --> 00:05:01.07
and show the most popular comments first.

115
00:05:01.07 --> 00:05:04.00
I don't want to let users see the ratings.

116
00:05:04.00 --> 00:05:05.07
I don't think it's needed

117
00:05:05.07 --> 00:05:08.06
and I'm going to apply a Creative
Comments Attribution License

118
00:05:08.06 --> 00:05:12.00
so people know that this
could be freely shared.

119
00:05:12.00 --> 00:05:13.04
There are no captions here

120
00:05:13.04 --> 00:05:17.00
so I'll say that this has
never aired on television,

121
00:05:17.00 --> 00:05:18.09
but I will allow this to be embedded

122
00:05:18.09 --> 00:05:21.03
and I will allow it to be published.

123
00:05:21.03 --> 00:05:24.00
There are no age restrictions.

124
00:05:24.00 --> 00:05:28.09
In this case, the category
is science and technology

125
00:05:28.09 --> 00:05:33.03
and the language it was
produced in was English.

126
00:05:33.03 --> 00:05:36.09
Now if I want to allow people
to put extra captions up,

127
00:05:36.09 --> 00:05:39.03
maybe they want to translate
this into another language,

128
00:05:39.03 --> 00:05:42.00
I can click to allow that.

129
00:05:42.00 --> 00:05:44.09
You don't have to put in a
recording date but you could.

130
00:05:44.09 --> 00:05:46.03
I'll turn off the statistics

131
00:05:46.03 --> 00:05:48.00
because I don't care to share those

132
00:05:48.00 --> 00:05:52.06
and this is not 3D content
nor was it paid placement.

133
00:05:52.06 --> 00:05:55.06
So now I'll click save changes

134
00:05:55.06 --> 00:05:58.05
and those changes are
now written to the file.

135
00:05:58.05 --> 00:06:01.05
Now for the most, this is going
to be handled under the hood.

136
00:06:01.05 --> 00:06:04.06
Not all of this information
is shown to the viewer,

137
00:06:04.06 --> 00:06:06.04
but this will control how the videos

138
00:06:06.04 --> 00:06:08.02
are searched and discovered

139
00:06:08.02 --> 00:06:12.04
and affect what information
is displayed on the page.

140
00:06:12.04 --> 00:06:17.04
So now if we go ahead and go
back to that page for a moment,

141
00:06:17.04 --> 00:06:20.06
you'll see that while
the viewer can like this,

142
00:06:20.06 --> 00:06:23.07
there are no stars shown on this video.

143
00:06:23.07 --> 00:06:25.09
And while they can post comments,

144
00:06:25.09 --> 00:06:28.01
if somebody logs in to post a comment,

145
00:06:28.01 --> 00:06:32.01
I'm going to have to approve it
before it appears on the page.

146
00:06:32.01 --> 00:06:34.08
So these types of controls
can be quite useful.
