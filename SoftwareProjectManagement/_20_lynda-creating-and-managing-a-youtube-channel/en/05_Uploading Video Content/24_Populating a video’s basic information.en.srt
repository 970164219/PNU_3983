1
00:00:00.05 --> 00:00:01.07
- When you upload a movie,

2
00:00:01.07 --> 00:00:04.08
it's important that you give
it some basic information.

3
00:00:04.08 --> 00:00:06.09
This makes the file discoverable

4
00:00:06.09 --> 00:00:10.04
so people can actually
learn and find your content.

5
00:00:10.04 --> 00:00:12.05
This makes the video
discoverable so people

6
00:00:12.05 --> 00:00:14.09
can actually find your content.

7
00:00:14.09 --> 00:00:16.03
While the video's uploading,

8
00:00:16.03 --> 00:00:18.06
you can actually load this information in.

9
00:00:18.06 --> 00:00:21.00
You don't have to wait for it to complete.

10
00:00:21.00 --> 00:00:22.09
The basic info's pretty simple.

11
00:00:22.09 --> 00:00:26.00
What you're looking for
is to fill in a title.

12
00:00:26.00 --> 00:00:29.00
So make sure you think about
search engine optimization,

13
00:00:29.00 --> 00:00:30.06
giving it a descriptive title,

14
00:00:30.06 --> 00:00:34.02
and that you keep this
title below 100 characters.

15
00:00:34.02 --> 00:00:39.03
Also, in the description area,
enter a detailed description.

16
00:00:39.03 --> 00:00:42.00
You can also put a website or a URL here

17
00:00:42.00 --> 00:00:44.09
so people can go and
find more information.

18
00:00:44.09 --> 00:00:48.01
But this is a great opportunity
to include key information.

19
00:00:48.01 --> 00:00:50.04
And remember that it's not just the title

20
00:00:50.04 --> 00:00:52.09
and the description that
helps people find it.

21
00:00:52.09 --> 00:00:55.03
They're gonna rely on
both of those properties

22
00:00:55.03 --> 00:00:58.08
and another one called keywords or tags.

23
00:00:58.08 --> 00:01:01.09
These tags can be put below the video.

24
00:01:01.09 --> 00:01:05.04
And what you're looking for
are topics that are similar.

25
00:01:05.04 --> 00:01:08.04
So you can tag a video with keywords

26
00:01:08.04 --> 00:01:10.01
and this is gonna be helpful.

27
00:01:10.01 --> 00:01:12.00
Additionally, what you'll find is that

28
00:01:12.00 --> 00:01:15.08
the system may suggest these
tags as you start to type.

29
00:01:15.08 --> 00:01:18.04
So consider using the auto-suggested tags

30
00:01:18.04 --> 00:01:20.03
as they're more common.

31
00:01:20.03 --> 00:01:23.07
Additionally, thumbnails are
going to be presented to you.

32
00:01:23.07 --> 00:01:26.00
You'll have the ability
to choose from three

33
00:01:26.00 --> 00:01:28.01
randomly selected thumbnails

34
00:01:28.01 --> 00:01:30.00
or if you have a verified account,

35
00:01:30.00 --> 00:01:33.06
you'll be able to upload
a custom thumbnail.

36
00:01:33.06 --> 00:01:36.01
Let's go ahead and upload
a video here for a moment.

37
00:01:36.01 --> 00:01:39.00
So you can see the general process

38
00:01:39.00 --> 00:01:41.02
of tagging the information.

39
00:01:41.02 --> 00:01:44.01
I'll choose this Aurora video here,

40
00:01:44.01 --> 00:01:46.04
and you see it begins to upload.

41
00:01:46.04 --> 00:01:49.04
The name has been pulled out of the file,

42
00:01:49.04 --> 00:01:53.02
but I can actually go ahead
and modify that if needed.

43
00:01:53.02 --> 00:01:56.06
Or enter a description here below.

44
00:01:56.06 --> 00:02:16.02
Let's go ahead and describe this video.

45
00:02:16.02 --> 00:02:18.00
Now you'll notice in that description

46
00:02:18.00 --> 00:02:21.00
I've mentioned the name of the software;

47
00:02:21.00 --> 00:02:24.03
I'll actually specify
the version here as well,

48
00:02:24.03 --> 00:02:26.08
the 2018 version of the software.

49
00:02:26.08 --> 00:02:29.09
I've included the name of
the company that makes it.

50
00:02:29.09 --> 00:02:32.03
I've also taken advantage here and put in

51
00:02:32.03 --> 00:02:35.06
my name and worked in the word photography

52
00:02:35.06 --> 00:02:38.05
and photographer into the description.

53
00:02:38.05 --> 00:02:40.06
Now, I'm using a service called Grammarly

54
00:02:40.06 --> 00:02:43.00
that makes it easy to
click and check the grammar

55
00:02:43.00 --> 00:02:44.05
if there is any issues.

56
00:02:44.05 --> 00:02:45.09
That's a third-party add-on,

57
00:02:45.09 --> 00:02:48.07
but not a bad idea as you're writing.

58
00:02:48.07 --> 00:02:52.03
Now below, I have the
ability to enter tags.

59
00:02:52.03 --> 00:02:57.05
Let's go ahead here and
set some information.

60
00:02:57.05 --> 00:03:13.01
And I place a comma between each tag.

61
00:03:13.01 --> 00:03:23.00
If you want to remove a tag,
just click the X box there.

62
00:03:23.00 --> 00:03:25.07
Now, I can choose the
status for the video here

63
00:03:25.07 --> 00:03:29.06
and I'll click on the pop-up
list and set this to Public.

64
00:03:29.06 --> 00:03:31.08
And if I wanted to share on Twitter,

65
00:03:31.08 --> 00:03:35.00
with a single click here,
I can go ahead and connect.

66
00:03:35.00 --> 00:03:36.09
And you'll see that
it'll give me the ability

67
00:03:36.09 --> 00:03:39.03
to authorize and connect the account.

68
00:03:39.03 --> 00:03:40.09
Now I'm gonna uncheck that for now,

69
00:03:40.09 --> 00:03:43.01
but remember this does
give you the ability

70
00:03:43.01 --> 00:03:45.03
to generate a tweet if you've connected

71
00:03:45.03 --> 00:03:49.03
your social network to
your YouTube account.

72
00:03:49.03 --> 00:03:52.01
Additionally if I want
to, I can make a playlist.

73
00:03:52.01 --> 00:03:54.02
Now I'll click this for right now,

74
00:03:54.02 --> 00:04:00.01
and make a new playlist
called Skylum Software.

75
00:04:00.01 --> 00:04:03.07
And click Create.

76
00:04:03.07 --> 00:04:07.01
Now what you'll notice is that
it's almost done uploading

77
00:04:07.01 --> 00:04:09.05
and I can see information here.

78
00:04:09.05 --> 00:04:13.05
The upload has finished,
that's what the first bar is,

79
00:04:13.05 --> 00:04:16.09
but the processing is the
evaluating of the file

80
00:04:16.09 --> 00:04:19.05
and getting it ready for compression.

81
00:04:19.05 --> 00:04:23.03
Now I have the ability here if
I'd like, to check the link.

82
00:04:23.03 --> 00:04:24.05
So if you're in a hurry

83
00:04:24.05 --> 00:04:26.02
or you need to share
the link with someone,

84
00:04:26.02 --> 00:04:28.06
you can actually put
this link onto a website

85
00:04:28.06 --> 00:04:30.02
or email it to someone,

86
00:04:30.02 --> 00:04:33.05
and when it's all done processing,
the video will be there.

87
00:04:33.05 --> 00:04:35.06
If I go to that page early,

88
00:04:35.06 --> 00:04:38.02
you'll see that it might
not have the video yet.

89
00:04:38.02 --> 00:04:40.01
It says that it's being processed,

90
00:04:40.01 --> 00:04:44.03
but the description and the
general information is there.

91
00:04:44.03 --> 00:04:45.09
If we go back to that page,

92
00:04:45.09 --> 00:04:48.01
you can see that it's almost done,

93
00:04:48.01 --> 00:04:51.04
and you can track the
status of the processing.

94
00:04:51.04 --> 00:04:53.01
Once this processing is done,

95
00:04:53.01 --> 00:04:56.02
video thumbnails will
appear at the bottom.

96
00:04:56.02 --> 00:04:57.05
And speaking of thumbnails,

97
00:04:57.05 --> 00:04:59.03
let's talk about those for a moment.
