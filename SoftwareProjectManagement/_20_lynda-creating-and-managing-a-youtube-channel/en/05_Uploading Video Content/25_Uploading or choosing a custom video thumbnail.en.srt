1
00:00:00.00 --> 00:00:01.09
- To add or change a thumbnail,

2
00:00:01.09 --> 00:00:05.08
simply login to YouTube and
then, under your Video Manager,

3
00:00:05.08 --> 00:00:08.06
you can easily access all your videos.

4
00:00:08.06 --> 00:00:11.09
Just click the Edit button
for an individual video.

5
00:00:11.09 --> 00:00:13.06
If you're also uploading a video,

6
00:00:13.06 --> 00:00:17.00
you can change the
thumbnail at time of upload.

7
00:00:17.00 --> 00:00:19.06
Now, on the screen itself,
you'll have the ability

8
00:00:19.06 --> 00:00:21.08
to choose a thumbnail or click

9
00:00:21.08 --> 00:00:23.08
to load up a custom thumbnail.

10
00:00:23.08 --> 00:00:27.03
And then, once you've
done so, you can hit Save.

11
00:00:27.03 --> 00:00:29.04
Now, you'll notice that, by default,

12
00:00:29.04 --> 00:00:33.03
sometimes just single shots
of people or software screens

13
00:00:33.03 --> 00:00:36.04
may not be as compelling
as a graphic identity

14
00:00:36.04 --> 00:00:40.02
that helps you better understand
what you're looking at.

15
00:00:40.02 --> 00:00:43.01
Here, for example, I
relied upon stock imagery.

16
00:00:43.01 --> 00:00:45.00
Since this was a bootcamp to teach you

17
00:00:45.00 --> 00:00:48.06
about new software, I
found a shot of a person

18
00:00:48.06 --> 00:00:51.08
exercising with a bit of
military type clothing.

19
00:00:51.08 --> 00:00:55.06
And it seemed to convey
the appropriate style.

20
00:00:55.06 --> 00:00:57.05
With those custom thumbnails, remember,

21
00:00:57.05 --> 00:01:00.08
the images need to be
16:9 and you really have

22
00:01:00.08 --> 00:01:04.03
a minimum resolution of about 1280x720.

23
00:01:04.03 --> 00:01:06.07
It will accept 640 thumbnails,

24
00:01:06.07 --> 00:01:09.01
but the larger thumbnails are
going to look a lot better

25
00:01:09.01 --> 00:01:12.02
on high resolution screens or televisions.

26
00:01:12.02 --> 00:01:15.09
It should be a JPEG, a GIF,
a bitmap, or a PNG file,

27
00:01:15.09 --> 00:01:18.01
but JPEG being the most common.

28
00:01:18.01 --> 00:01:22.03
And you need to keep the file
size below two megabytes.

29
00:01:22.03 --> 00:01:23.08
Now, here's another example,

30
00:01:23.08 --> 00:01:26.02
working in the logo of a product,

31
00:01:26.02 --> 00:01:29.03
a photo that's colored and tinted to match

32
00:01:29.03 --> 00:01:32.09
and nice big text, making
it easy for people to know

33
00:01:32.09 --> 00:01:35.08
what the video is about
as they're browsing.

34
00:01:35.08 --> 00:01:38.01
If you take the time to put
those custom thumbnails in,

35
00:01:38.01 --> 00:01:41.05
you'll see that they have
a nice impact on views,

36
00:01:41.05 --> 00:01:43.05
and generally speaking, custom thumbnails

37
00:01:43.05 --> 00:01:45.05
will help drive traffic.

38
00:01:45.05 --> 00:01:48.06
The thumbnails do need to
follow the community guidelines

39
00:01:48.06 --> 00:01:49.08
that YouTube sets up.

40
00:01:49.08 --> 00:01:52.07
What this means is that they
can't be sexually suggestive.

41
00:01:52.07 --> 00:01:56.07
They need to be PG rated and,
really, not offend folks.

42
00:01:56.07 --> 00:01:59.03
So the thumbnails need to be really rated

43
00:01:59.03 --> 00:02:00.07
for anybody to see it.

44
00:02:00.07 --> 00:02:03.08
If you do put something
too racy into a thumbnail,

45
00:02:03.08 --> 00:02:05.00
it's going to cause problems.

46
00:02:05.00 --> 00:02:07.00
They might flag it and take it down.

47
00:02:07.00 --> 00:02:09.03
Or if you get too many of
these hits against you,

48
00:02:09.03 --> 00:02:12.03
they'll actually block you
from having this ability.

49
00:02:12.03 --> 00:02:15.06
So, what it comes down to, is
make sure that the thumbnail

50
00:02:15.06 --> 00:02:18.07
doesn't cause your video
to be age restricted.

51
00:02:18.07 --> 00:02:21.02
If you do have an age restricted video,

52
00:02:21.02 --> 00:02:24.05
then ads are not allowed
to appear on your video

53
00:02:24.05 --> 00:02:27.04
if you're hoping to monetize it.

54
00:02:27.04 --> 00:02:31.03
Additionally, if you upload
thumbnails that are too racy

55
00:02:31.03 --> 00:02:33.09
and you are consistently
abusing the privilege here,

56
00:02:33.09 --> 00:02:36.04
putting up things that
are sexually suggestive

57
00:02:36.04 --> 00:02:39.04
or copyrighted images that
you don't have rights to,

58
00:02:39.04 --> 00:02:41.07
then what's going to happen is
that your thumbnail privileges

59
00:02:41.07 --> 00:02:43.00
can be revoked.

60
00:02:43.00 --> 00:02:44.06
And if YouTube revokes them,

61
00:02:44.06 --> 00:02:47.01
they will not give them
back to your account.

62
00:02:47.01 --> 00:02:48.04
There is no appeal.

63
00:02:48.04 --> 00:02:49.09
There is no asking nicely.

64
00:02:49.09 --> 00:02:51.07
There is no promising to be good.

65
00:02:51.07 --> 00:02:53.07
You have lost that privilege.

66
00:02:53.07 --> 00:02:56.04
So, how do custom thumbnails work?

67
00:02:56.04 --> 00:02:57.05
Well, it's pretty simple.

68
00:02:57.05 --> 00:03:00.06
I'm going to show you inside
of the editing dialog box

69
00:03:00.06 --> 00:03:01.09
and then we'll take advantage

70
00:03:01.09 --> 00:03:04.05
from the Video Manager as well.

71
00:03:04.05 --> 00:03:06.01
So here, we've got the ability

72
00:03:06.01 --> 00:03:09.01
to modify the description of the video.

73
00:03:09.01 --> 00:03:11.05
You'll see that, what
it's done, is it's pulled

74
00:03:11.05 --> 00:03:15.01
three suggested thumbnails
from the video itself.

75
00:03:15.01 --> 00:03:16.06
And if I click on one of these,

76
00:03:16.06 --> 00:03:19.03
it's going to change
that to be the thumbnail.

77
00:03:19.03 --> 00:03:22.01
So let's go ahead and set
it to this for a moment

78
00:03:22.01 --> 00:03:24.07
and I'll click Publish.

79
00:03:24.07 --> 00:03:27.05
Well, what happens is
that video goes live.

80
00:03:27.05 --> 00:03:29.08
So if we go to the product
page for that video

81
00:03:29.08 --> 00:03:32.07
and hit refresh, you'll
see that, in a moment,

82
00:03:32.07 --> 00:03:36.05
the video comes up and it starts to play.

83
00:03:36.05 --> 00:03:38.05
And that's easy enough,
but you might be wondering,

84
00:03:38.05 --> 00:03:40.04
well, where is that thumbnail?

85
00:03:40.04 --> 00:03:42.03
Well, the thumbnail is what shows up

86
00:03:42.03 --> 00:03:45.03
on the page itself or in search.

87
00:03:45.03 --> 00:03:48.02
Now, if you decide to,
under your Video Manager,

88
00:03:48.02 --> 00:03:50.07
you can also edit it there.

89
00:03:50.07 --> 00:03:53.00
So this video is currently set to public.

90
00:03:53.00 --> 00:03:55.03
It may take a moment to hit my page.

91
00:03:55.03 --> 00:03:57.01
But if I want to change the thumbnail,

92
00:03:57.01 --> 00:03:59.05
I can click on the Edit button.

93
00:03:59.05 --> 00:04:02.01
And this will take me
back to the same dialog,

94
00:04:02.01 --> 00:04:04.04
or at least one that's very similar.

95
00:04:04.04 --> 00:04:06.09
You can now do additional
editing to the content

96
00:04:06.09 --> 00:04:12.00
if you'd like, or change the
thumbnails here as you see fit.

97
00:04:12.00 --> 00:04:14.04
If you want to upload a custom thumbnail,

98
00:04:14.04 --> 00:04:18.00
simply click the Custom thumbnail button.

99
00:04:18.00 --> 00:04:22.00
And now, you can navigate to a JPEG file.

100
00:04:22.00 --> 00:04:24.03
Select it and click Choose,

101
00:04:24.03 --> 00:04:27.00
and the custom thumbnail will upload.

102
00:04:27.00 --> 00:04:29.06
Once that's done, you'll see
that it's added to the list

103
00:04:29.06 --> 00:04:33.07
and you can click to set
that as a custom thumbnail.

104
00:04:33.07 --> 00:04:36.03
Now, by default, when you
upload the custom one,

105
00:04:36.03 --> 00:04:38.08
it's going to be selected with a border

106
00:04:38.08 --> 00:04:41.00
and it will say available.

107
00:04:41.00 --> 00:04:44.02
You can click on other
images here to change them,

108
00:04:44.02 --> 00:04:47.02
but clicking back here
will set that image.

109
00:04:47.02 --> 00:04:48.04
If you want to change it,

110
00:04:48.04 --> 00:04:51.05
just click again on Change image.

111
00:04:51.05 --> 00:04:54.06
Now, when I click Save
changes, it will update

112
00:04:54.06 --> 00:04:58.00
and that becomes the custom thumbnail.

113
00:04:58.00 --> 00:04:59.02
Now it may take a moment,

114
00:04:59.02 --> 00:05:01.08
but once it hits your channel or page,

115
00:05:01.08 --> 00:05:03.01
that should be available

116
00:05:03.01 --> 00:05:05.04
and you'll be able to see your video.
