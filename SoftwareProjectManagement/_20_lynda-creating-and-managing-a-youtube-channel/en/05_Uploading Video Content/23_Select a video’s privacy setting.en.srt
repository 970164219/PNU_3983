1
00:00:00.05 --> 00:00:02.03
- One of the next choices you have

2
00:00:02.03 --> 00:00:05.03
is how a video's privacy is set.

3
00:00:05.03 --> 00:00:06.05
This is pretty straightforward,

4
00:00:06.05 --> 00:00:07.08
but it comes down to

5
00:00:07.08 --> 00:00:10.04
how do you want people to find your video

6
00:00:10.04 --> 00:00:13.03
and you'll find a couple of
choices available in YouTube

7
00:00:13.03 --> 00:00:15.00
depending upon if you're a member

8
00:00:15.00 --> 00:00:17.04
of the Partner Program or not.

9
00:00:17.04 --> 00:00:20.00
So first up is a public video

10
00:00:20.00 --> 00:00:22.05
and this is a video
that everybody can see.

11
00:00:22.05 --> 00:00:24.02
It can be embedded freely,

12
00:00:24.02 --> 00:00:26.07
but you do still have the
option on public videos

13
00:00:26.07 --> 00:00:28.04
to turn off embedding,

14
00:00:28.04 --> 00:00:31.07
but public videos can be
searched and found by anybody

15
00:00:31.07 --> 00:00:35.08
using a standard search on YouTube.

16
00:00:35.08 --> 00:00:39.01
Another category is
unlisted and what this means

17
00:00:39.01 --> 00:00:42.04
is that only people who
have the link can view it.

18
00:00:42.04 --> 00:00:44.04
Now they can share the link freely.

19
00:00:44.04 --> 00:00:46.00
They can send it to a friend.

20
00:00:46.00 --> 00:00:48.03
There are no password protection on it,

21
00:00:48.03 --> 00:00:51.03
but it is essentially like
an unlisted phone number

22
00:00:51.03 --> 00:00:54.05
which means that if people
pass it around or share it,

23
00:00:54.05 --> 00:00:55.07
well it's there.

24
00:00:55.07 --> 00:00:57.09
Some folks will do unlisted videos

25
00:00:57.09 --> 00:01:00.09
so they can test out how
effective their blog is

26
00:01:00.09 --> 00:01:04.05
or to see if social media
can drive traffic to a page.

27
00:01:04.05 --> 00:01:07.04
And if you really only want
people to find the video

28
00:01:07.04 --> 00:01:08.09
because they've been told about it,

29
00:01:08.09 --> 00:01:11.04
well then unlisted comes in handy.

30
00:01:11.04 --> 00:01:12.07
With unlisted videos,

31
00:01:12.07 --> 00:01:15.04
do keep in mind that they will not show up

32
00:01:15.04 --> 00:01:16.09
on your channel or page

33
00:01:16.09 --> 00:01:19.05
and they don't show up in search results,

34
00:01:19.05 --> 00:01:22.02
but other people do have the ability

35
00:01:22.02 --> 00:01:25.05
to put an unlisted video into a playlist.

36
00:01:25.05 --> 00:01:28.07
So what this means is is that
it doesn't show up in search

37
00:01:28.07 --> 00:01:31.05
and it doesn't show up on your page,

38
00:01:31.05 --> 00:01:34.03
but it still can be shared by other people

39
00:01:34.03 --> 00:01:37.09
or embedded or added to a playlist.

40
00:01:37.09 --> 00:01:40.08
Now another style is a private video.

41
00:01:40.08 --> 00:01:44.05
A private video is a video
that only you can see.

42
00:01:44.05 --> 00:01:45.08
Now with private videos,

43
00:01:45.08 --> 00:01:47.05
they're not going to show
up on the channel page.

44
00:01:47.05 --> 00:01:49.01
They're not going to show up in search,

45
00:01:49.01 --> 00:01:52.03
but they're not going to show
up for other people either.

46
00:01:52.03 --> 00:01:55.02
If you want somebody
to see a private video,

47
00:01:55.02 --> 00:01:58.05
you have to invite them via email.

48
00:01:58.05 --> 00:02:00.01
Now typically what will happen is

49
00:02:00.01 --> 00:02:01.03
they'll receive the message

50
00:02:01.03 --> 00:02:04.01
and then when they click
to log into YouTube,

51
00:02:04.01 --> 00:02:06.02
it will make sure that
they're logged into YouTube

52
00:02:06.02 --> 00:02:07.09
or ask them to create an account

53
00:02:07.09 --> 00:02:09.09
and then they're going
to be able to see it.

54
00:02:09.09 --> 00:02:13.03
So you can't just forward
this message to somebody else.

55
00:02:13.03 --> 00:02:15.00
Typically it's a one-time link

56
00:02:15.00 --> 00:02:18.01
that's going to tie back to
the person's email address.

57
00:02:18.01 --> 00:02:20.00
There is one other type of video

58
00:02:20.00 --> 00:02:22.02
and that is a scheduled video.

59
00:02:22.02 --> 00:02:25.00
This is a video that you upload and queue

60
00:02:25.00 --> 00:02:26.02
for future release.

61
00:02:26.02 --> 00:02:28.02
So you have the ability to set the date,

62
00:02:28.02 --> 00:02:30.01
the time, and the timezone.

63
00:02:30.01 --> 00:02:32.01
Scheduled videos are quite useful

64
00:02:32.01 --> 00:02:33.08
because maybe you have a product launch

65
00:02:33.08 --> 00:02:36.03
or a big campaign that's starting.

66
00:02:36.03 --> 00:02:39.02
You can upload the video and
set it to private initially

67
00:02:39.02 --> 00:02:41.04
and then when you know the release date,

68
00:02:41.04 --> 00:02:44.08
exactly set it for when
it's supposed to go live.

69
00:02:44.08 --> 00:02:46.05
These controls are accurate

70
00:02:46.05 --> 00:02:50.00
and allow you to really tie
these to marketing efforts.

71
00:02:50.00 --> 00:02:52.04
Now a couple more pieces
of practical advice.

72
00:02:52.04 --> 00:02:55.02
First up, both private and unlisted videos

73
00:02:55.02 --> 00:02:57.04
could be quite useful for team review

74
00:02:57.04 --> 00:02:59.09
and are great if you need
to pass something around

75
00:02:59.09 --> 00:03:01.01
to get feedback,

76
00:03:01.01 --> 00:03:03.03
but do remember that
anything on the internet

77
00:03:03.03 --> 00:03:05.03
is never truly private.

78
00:03:05.03 --> 00:03:07.08
So even if you have a video set to private

79
00:03:07.08 --> 00:03:10.03
and you've set it so that
it can't be embedded,

80
00:03:10.03 --> 00:03:12.02
well people might still be able

81
00:03:12.02 --> 00:03:15.07
to run screen capture
software and capture the video

82
00:03:15.07 --> 00:03:18.02
or take their cellphone and
point it right at the screen

83
00:03:18.02 --> 00:03:20.04
and record it and upload that.

84
00:03:20.04 --> 00:03:22.08
So if privacy is a concern,

85
00:03:22.08 --> 00:03:25.07
don't use YouTube because
no matter what you do,

86
00:03:25.07 --> 00:03:29.02
once it's on the net, somebody
can find a way of sharing it,

87
00:03:29.02 --> 00:03:31.04
but these privacy controls do help.

88
00:03:31.04 --> 00:03:34.08
Lastly, remember that there
are more secure methods

89
00:03:34.08 --> 00:03:38.00
available to you,
password protected sites,

90
00:03:38.00 --> 00:03:40.02
digital downloads that are encrypted.

91
00:03:40.02 --> 00:03:41.06
There are lots of solutions

92
00:03:41.06 --> 00:03:44.04
if you truly need to
deliver something securely.

93
00:03:44.04 --> 00:03:46.03
All right, let me show
you how to upload a video

94
00:03:46.03 --> 00:03:47.07
and choose these settings.

95
00:03:47.07 --> 00:03:49.02
It's really pretty straightforward.

96
00:03:49.02 --> 00:03:52.08
When you're logged into YouTube
on whatever page you're on,

97
00:03:52.08 --> 00:03:56.07
you'll notice in the top
toolbar an upload button.

98
00:03:56.07 --> 00:03:58.09
Make sure that you're
logged into the account

99
00:03:58.09 --> 00:04:01.09
that you want to upload to.

100
00:04:01.09 --> 00:04:06.03
Click the upload button
and a new window pops up.

101
00:04:06.03 --> 00:04:10.04
Now what you can do is
click to select a file.

102
00:04:10.04 --> 00:04:14.07
Now let's select a video
here and I'll click choose.

103
00:04:14.07 --> 00:04:17.07
You'll notice that it starts
to upload automatically

104
00:04:17.07 --> 00:04:19.09
and from the popup list here,

105
00:04:19.09 --> 00:04:23.03
we can choose how that video is uploaded.

106
00:04:23.03 --> 00:04:25.02
That's quite useful.

107
00:04:25.02 --> 00:04:28.04
Let me cancel for a second here.

108
00:04:28.04 --> 00:04:31.01
You'll also notice on the upload button

109
00:04:31.01 --> 00:04:34.02
that you have the ability
to set that beforehand.

110
00:04:34.02 --> 00:04:37.00
So if you intend to
upload multiple videos,

111
00:04:37.00 --> 00:04:39.06
you can change that so
the same privacy setting

112
00:04:39.06 --> 00:04:41.09
is applied to all videos.

113
00:04:41.09 --> 00:04:44.02
Now we'll revisit this
screen in just a moment,

114
00:04:44.02 --> 00:04:46.01
but it's a simple popup

115
00:04:46.01 --> 00:04:48.02
whether you want to set it for all uploads

116
00:04:48.02 --> 00:04:52.02
before you add them in or
individually movie by movie.
