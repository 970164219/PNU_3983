1
00:00:00.04 --> 00:00:02.04
- One of the most common
questions I get is,

2
00:00:02.04 --> 00:00:05.01
how to do I re-upload a video to YouTube?

3
00:00:05.01 --> 00:00:08.02
It's been live for a couple
of weeks and we made a change,

4
00:00:08.02 --> 00:00:10.04
or an update, or there's a mistake

5
00:00:10.04 --> 00:00:12.01
and I need to put a new version up.

6
00:00:12.01 --> 00:00:13.07
But the client's already embedded it

7
00:00:13.07 --> 00:00:14.09
and I don't want to have to change

8
00:00:14.09 --> 00:00:17.04
the URL or the embed code.

9
00:00:17.04 --> 00:00:21.04
Well, if you've jumped right
to this video using a search,

10
00:00:21.04 --> 00:00:23.01
and you haven't watched the whole course,

11
00:00:23.01 --> 00:00:25.09
I've got bad news for you. You can't.

12
00:00:25.09 --> 00:00:28.00
You cannot replace a video on YouTube.

13
00:00:28.00 --> 00:00:31.08
You can simply unpublish it
and put something else in.

14
00:00:31.08 --> 00:00:33.05
Now for those of you paying attention

15
00:00:33.05 --> 00:00:34.08
to the status bar down below,

16
00:00:34.08 --> 00:00:37.00
you're probably wondering,
"Why does he keep talking?".

17
00:00:37.00 --> 00:00:39.08
Well there are some alternatives
I'd like you to know about.

18
00:00:39.08 --> 00:00:41.09
While you can't replace a video,

19
00:00:41.09 --> 00:00:43.08
there are a few useful things.

20
00:00:43.08 --> 00:00:47.00
Keep in mind that the reason
why you can't replace a video

21
00:00:47.00 --> 00:00:49.08
and keep the original view
count, comments, or ratings,

22
00:00:49.08 --> 00:00:53.05
is that YouTube doesn't want
you to do bait and switch.

23
00:00:53.05 --> 00:00:55.04
So when you upload a new video,

24
00:00:55.04 --> 00:00:57.05
YouTube is going to make a new URL

25
00:00:57.05 --> 00:01:00.08
and reset the view count
and reset the comments.

26
00:01:00.08 --> 00:01:02.04
They don't want people to have a video up

27
00:01:02.04 --> 00:01:04.04
that gets one type of
comments and ratings,

28
00:01:04.04 --> 00:01:08.03
and then have people swap
it out for an advertisement.

29
00:01:08.03 --> 00:01:10.02
Some other services like Vimeo

30
00:01:10.02 --> 00:01:12.04
and others do support this feature.

31
00:01:12.04 --> 00:01:16.00
So if versioning is important
with permanent URLs,

32
00:01:16.00 --> 00:01:19.01
look into a service other than YouTube.

33
00:01:19.01 --> 00:01:21.04
But the idea here is they don't want to

34
00:01:21.04 --> 00:01:24.07
really build mistrust with the audience.

35
00:01:24.07 --> 00:01:28.04
For example, if you had
this ability to use one URL,

36
00:01:28.04 --> 00:01:31.04
maybe you put up a really popular video,

37
00:01:31.04 --> 00:01:34.03
or somebody sells their popular video slot

38
00:01:34.03 --> 00:01:36.08
and then you have all of
that traffic, ratings,

39
00:01:36.08 --> 00:01:39.07
and total view counts and you replace it

40
00:01:39.07 --> 00:01:41.08
with an advertisement or something else.

41
00:01:41.08 --> 00:01:43.01
What YouTube doesn't want to see happen

42
00:01:43.01 --> 00:01:45.06
is that people are selling popular slots.

43
00:01:45.06 --> 00:01:47.07
For example, a video has a lot of hits,

44
00:01:47.07 --> 00:01:50.03
and then they put up a new
version that has ads on it.

45
00:01:50.03 --> 00:01:53.05
Or a video is one type of content that

46
00:01:53.05 --> 00:01:55.08
has all these great reviews about how

47
00:01:55.08 --> 00:01:58.02
family-friendly this is and awesome it is,

48
00:01:58.02 --> 00:01:59.08
and then someone uploads something

49
00:01:59.08 --> 00:02:02.02
that was inappropriate for the audience.

50
00:02:02.02 --> 00:02:04.01
YouTube is really particular that

51
00:02:04.01 --> 00:02:08.05
what you upload is a unique
file, so keep that in mind.

52
00:02:08.05 --> 00:02:10.06
But you can do a few other things.

53
00:02:10.06 --> 00:02:12.08
For example, you can actually put links to

54
00:02:12.08 --> 00:02:18.05
the new version using the card
functionality or annotations.

55
00:02:18.05 --> 00:02:21.02
Additionally, you can enhance the video.

56
00:02:21.02 --> 00:02:24.02
This allows you to make some basic changes

57
00:02:24.02 --> 00:02:26.09
using the YouTube video enhancements tab.

58
00:02:26.09 --> 00:02:30.00
For example, you can actually
trim parts of the video,

59
00:02:30.00 --> 00:02:34.00
adjust the audio, or auto
fix the exposure and color,

60
00:02:34.00 --> 00:02:36.09
or blur parts of the video to hide things.

61
00:02:36.09 --> 00:02:38.06
This can be quite useful.

62
00:02:38.06 --> 00:02:42.02
For example, I use YouTube's
live streaming platform a lot.

63
00:02:42.02 --> 00:02:44.02
And the first few minutes of a live stream

64
00:02:44.02 --> 00:02:46.01
are typically everyone sitting around

65
00:02:46.01 --> 00:02:47.08
waiting for people to show up.

66
00:02:47.08 --> 00:02:50.01
You start the stream early so people know,

67
00:02:50.01 --> 00:02:51.07
hey we're starting in about five minutes,

68
00:02:51.07 --> 00:02:54.05
or thanks to you who are
coming out and tuning in,

69
00:02:54.05 --> 00:02:55.05
because it takes a while for people

70
00:02:55.05 --> 00:02:57.04
to notice that the stream has started.

71
00:02:57.04 --> 00:02:59.07
So those first couple minutes are a pause.

72
00:02:59.07 --> 00:03:01.05
Well maybe you trim that out.

73
00:03:01.05 --> 00:03:03.02
Or maybe there's a section of the video

74
00:03:03.02 --> 00:03:06.04
that really got off track,
you can get rid of it.

75
00:03:06.04 --> 00:03:07.06
Maybe there's a mistake.

76
00:03:07.06 --> 00:03:10.04
Well you can cut things out from a video.

77
00:03:10.04 --> 00:03:13.07
You just can't add. So let me show you.

78
00:03:13.07 --> 00:03:16.00
If you're logged into your account,

79
00:03:16.00 --> 00:03:20.08
simply go to the video
manager. And then click edit.

80
00:03:20.08 --> 00:03:25.05
You'll see that the second
tab is called enhancements.

81
00:03:25.05 --> 00:03:28.01
This is where you have
the ability to adjust.

82
00:03:28.01 --> 00:03:32.00
So you can actually fix a
video for exposure and color,

83
00:03:32.00 --> 00:03:36.04
or stabilize, change the
speed, or click the trim button

84
00:03:36.04 --> 00:03:39.08
to actually remove parts of the video.

85
00:03:39.08 --> 00:03:42.05
So if you want to shorten
a video, you can do so,

86
00:03:42.05 --> 00:03:47.02
allowing you to take
part of a longer video.

87
00:03:47.02 --> 00:03:49.09
Now you can also split
a video if you need to,

88
00:03:49.09 --> 00:03:51.07
to make different parts.

89
00:03:51.07 --> 00:03:54.00
And this allows you to basically go to

90
00:03:54.00 --> 00:03:56.07
a certain part of the
video and click split.

91
00:03:56.07 --> 00:03:58.06
And then you can adjust those parts

92
00:03:58.06 --> 00:04:01.03
and then go to another
part and split it again.

93
00:04:01.03 --> 00:04:03.01
Now I'm going to click clear for a moment

94
00:04:03.01 --> 00:04:05.08
and take a look at some
of these other choices.

95
00:04:05.08 --> 00:04:07.07
Let's mark done here.

96
00:04:07.07 --> 00:04:10.09
You'll see that you also
have some basic filters.

97
00:04:10.09 --> 00:04:12.03
Now these are not going to be

98
00:04:12.03 --> 00:04:13.06
useful for things like screencast,

99
00:04:13.06 --> 00:04:17.01
but you can adjust or
stylize the video a bit.

100
00:04:17.01 --> 00:04:18.09
And there are some blurring effects here

101
00:04:18.09 --> 00:04:22.09
if you need to blur faces
or apply custom areas that

102
00:04:22.09 --> 00:04:27.03
you want to track and blur to
hide them in the video itself.

103
00:04:27.03 --> 00:04:29.04
This is really quite useful.

104
00:04:29.04 --> 00:04:32.03
I also mentioned the idea of end screens,

105
00:04:32.03 --> 00:04:34.05
and cards, and annotations.

106
00:04:34.05 --> 00:04:36.07
End screens allow people to tell them

107
00:04:36.07 --> 00:04:39.08
where you want them to go
next. It's pretty simple.

108
00:04:39.08 --> 00:04:42.07
And cards, which we'll
talk about more later,

109
00:04:42.07 --> 00:04:45.04
allow us to put specific call outs.

110
00:04:45.04 --> 00:04:47.00
So if there is a new video,

111
00:04:47.00 --> 00:04:49.06
we can actually link to it and add a link

112
00:04:49.06 --> 00:04:52.00
right on the screen as an overlay.

113
00:04:52.00 --> 00:04:54.03
So that can be quite useful.

114
00:04:54.03 --> 00:04:56.03
So while you can't replace a video,

115
00:04:56.03 --> 00:05:00.06
you can edit its description,
change its link, its title,

116
00:05:00.06 --> 00:05:03.03
put in a link to a new
version of the video,

117
00:05:03.03 --> 00:05:05.00
cut away parts you don't want to see,

118
00:05:05.00 --> 00:05:07.08
blur out something you don't
have permission to show.

119
00:05:07.08 --> 00:05:09.09
There is quite a bit you can do without

120
00:05:09.09 --> 00:05:13.08
the ability of doing a
replace from an upload.
