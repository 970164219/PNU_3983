1
00:00:00.04 --> 00:00:02.04
- By no means am I a lawyer.

2
00:00:02.04 --> 00:00:06.03
So if terms of service matter
to you or your organization,

3
00:00:06.03 --> 00:00:09.06
you might want to seek legal
counsel to discuss them.

4
00:00:09.06 --> 00:00:13.00
But there are a few things
in YouTube's terms of service

5
00:00:13.00 --> 00:00:14.07
that bother my lawyer,

6
00:00:14.07 --> 00:00:16.06
and have actually caused problems

7
00:00:16.06 --> 00:00:18.07
for me with certain clients.

8
00:00:18.07 --> 00:00:20.07
Let's take a look at a
couple of the key things

9
00:00:20.07 --> 00:00:21.05
that you want to keep

10
00:00:21.05 --> 00:00:24.09
in mind if you're going to
upload content to YouTube.

11
00:00:24.09 --> 00:00:26.08
First up, if you've never read them,

12
00:00:26.08 --> 00:00:28.05
I would strongly suggest

13
00:00:28.05 --> 00:00:31.02
that you take a look at
the terms of service.

14
00:00:31.02 --> 00:00:33.04
There is a link on most pages on YouTube,

15
00:00:33.04 --> 00:00:36.07
and this conveys additional information.

16
00:00:36.07 --> 00:00:38.09
Some of the categories,
we'll talk about what

17
00:00:38.09 --> 00:00:40.08
you can do if you're
using the paid version

18
00:00:40.08 --> 00:00:42.03
of YouTube for subscriptions.

19
00:00:42.03 --> 00:00:46.02
Things like YouTube Red
or YouTube television.

20
00:00:46.02 --> 00:00:48.00
You'll also see additional information

21
00:00:48.00 --> 00:00:50.08
there about community guidelines
and copyright notices,

22
00:00:50.08 --> 00:00:53.00
but the one that you should
really take a look at

23
00:00:53.00 --> 00:00:55.04
is the general terms of service.

24
00:00:55.04 --> 00:00:57.07
And by uploading to YouTube,

25
00:00:57.07 --> 00:01:00.07
you agree to these terms of service.

26
00:01:00.07 --> 00:01:01.07
The big section that you

27
00:01:01.07 --> 00:01:05.05
want to pay attention to is
the Your Content and Conduct.

28
00:01:05.05 --> 00:01:07.00
For example, you'll notice

29
00:01:07.00 --> 00:01:10.08
that YouTube does not
guarantee confidentiality.

30
00:01:10.08 --> 00:01:13.06
So just because you upload
a video and set it private,

31
00:01:13.06 --> 00:01:17.09
does not mean that YouTube
has to keep it private.

32
00:01:17.09 --> 00:01:20.00
It does say that you are responsible

33
00:01:20.00 --> 00:01:21.06
for the content and consequences.

34
00:01:21.06 --> 00:01:24.00
So by publishing it to YouTube,

35
00:01:24.00 --> 00:01:26.06
they're not responsible
for any legal issues

36
00:01:26.06 --> 00:01:28.03
that you might face for upload.

37
00:01:28.03 --> 00:01:30.03
And if you're putting this up on YouTube,

38
00:01:30.03 --> 00:01:33.05
you basically give YouTube
a license to patent,

39
00:01:33.05 --> 00:01:34.07
trademark, trade secrets,

40
00:01:34.07 --> 00:01:38.04
copyright or other proprietary
rights in the content.

41
00:01:38.04 --> 00:01:40.01
This doesn't mean that they own it,

42
00:01:40.01 --> 00:01:43.06
but you're saying that you have
the rights to publish this,

43
00:01:43.06 --> 00:01:47.06
and YouTube is able to actually see this,

44
00:01:47.06 --> 00:01:51.05
and reshare the content
without legal repercussions.

45
00:01:51.05 --> 00:01:54.02
So if someone in your company
uploads a video to YouTube

46
00:01:54.02 --> 00:02:00.03
and reveals trade secrets,
well, YouTube is not liable.

47
00:02:00.03 --> 00:02:03.07
Now, YouTube does say that
you actually own your content.

48
00:02:03.07 --> 00:02:06.07
For clarity, you retain all
of your ownership rights.

49
00:02:06.07 --> 00:02:09.03
However, and this is a big however,

50
00:02:09.03 --> 00:02:14.06
you grant YouTube a worldwide
nonexclusive royalty-free,

51
00:02:14.06 --> 00:02:18.03
sublicensable, and
transferable license to use,

52
00:02:18.03 --> 00:02:22.03
reproduce, distribute, and
prepare derivative works.

53
00:02:22.03 --> 00:02:24.04
Let me break that down.

54
00:02:24.04 --> 00:02:25.09
Yes, you own your stuff,

55
00:02:25.09 --> 00:02:28.05
but you've given it to another company,

56
00:02:28.05 --> 00:02:31.02
who can remix it, share it,

57
00:02:31.02 --> 00:02:33.00
license it and take money for it,

58
00:02:33.00 --> 00:02:35.06
monetize it, put it anywhere they want,

59
00:02:35.06 --> 00:02:37.06
change it and do whatever they need to

60
00:02:37.06 --> 00:02:41.03
to it with you having no say whatsoever.

61
00:02:41.03 --> 00:02:43.04
Now, when people complain about this,

62
00:02:43.04 --> 00:02:45.09
I point out to them a real simple fact.

63
00:02:45.09 --> 00:02:48.05
You get what you pay for.

64
00:02:48.05 --> 00:02:50.08
YouTube is a free service,

65
00:02:50.08 --> 00:02:53.07
and Google needs to monetize that content.

66
00:02:53.07 --> 00:02:55.04
So they're going to put ads on it.

67
00:02:55.04 --> 00:02:56.06
They're going to license it,

68
00:02:56.06 --> 00:02:58.05
they might even sell your content

69
00:02:58.05 --> 00:03:00.02
or put it into a subscription service

70
00:03:00.02 --> 00:03:02.04
and not share the revenue with you.

71
00:03:02.04 --> 00:03:04.09
If this bothers you, or you need

72
00:03:04.09 --> 00:03:07.00
to maintain your legal rights,

73
00:03:07.00 --> 00:03:10.01
take a look at a plethora
of other hosting solutions

74
00:03:10.01 --> 00:03:13.00
that are out there that have
different terms of service,

75
00:03:13.00 --> 00:03:16.08
particularly ones where
you pay to host the video.

76
00:03:16.08 --> 00:03:19.06
Most paid services, such as Vimeo,

77
00:03:19.06 --> 00:03:22.01
will say that you own your content,

78
00:03:22.01 --> 00:03:25.07
and that those rights are
much more restricted on behalf

79
00:03:25.07 --> 00:03:27.02
of the other company,

80
00:03:27.02 --> 00:03:30.00
because you're paying
for that hosting service.

81
00:03:30.00 --> 00:03:32.03
But with YouTube, you're not paying.

82
00:03:32.03 --> 00:03:35.01
Therefore, you're giving
up a tremendous amount

83
00:03:35.01 --> 00:03:38.02
of rights, and while that
might not bother you,

84
00:03:38.02 --> 00:03:41.00
make sure it doesn't bother
the company or the client

85
00:03:41.00 --> 00:03:42.05
that you're doing work for.

86
00:03:42.05 --> 00:03:44.01
Other things to think about.

87
00:03:44.01 --> 00:03:46.05
You agreed that the content does not

88
00:03:46.05 --> 00:03:48.07
have copyrighted materials in it.

89
00:03:48.07 --> 00:03:51.05
And that you have the
rights to put this up.

90
00:03:51.05 --> 00:03:54.06
So you are saying that you
bear the responsibility

91
00:03:54.06 --> 00:03:56.07
that you have the rights to post.

92
00:03:56.07 --> 00:03:59.00
It also says that you're
not going to violate

93
00:03:59.00 --> 00:04:01.03
the community guidelines
which are well-suited

94
00:04:01.03 --> 00:04:03.03
and you should look at
those community guidelines.

95
00:04:03.03 --> 00:04:04.04
There's lots of things

96
00:04:04.04 --> 00:04:05.03
that YouTube wants you

97
00:04:05.03 --> 00:04:10.09
to follow about what's acceptable to post.

98
00:04:10.09 --> 00:04:14.05
Also, YouTube does not imply endorsement.

99
00:04:14.05 --> 00:04:16.04
Just because something is on YouTube,

100
00:04:16.04 --> 00:04:19.00
doesn't mean that YouTube believes in it.

101
00:04:19.00 --> 00:04:21.09
So if somebody posts
something hateful or something

102
00:04:21.09 --> 00:04:23.03
that shouldn't be shared,

103
00:04:23.03 --> 00:04:26.04
YouTube does reserve the
rights to remove the content

104
00:04:26.04 --> 00:04:31.00
with no notification.

105
00:04:31.00 --> 00:04:34.04
Additionally, YouTube does
support copyright enforcement.

106
00:04:34.04 --> 00:04:38.01
So if you find that your content
has been shared illegally,

107
00:04:38.01 --> 00:04:41.05
there are ways to submit
a copyright complaint.

108
00:04:41.05 --> 00:04:43.07
And this allows you to take down content

109
00:04:43.07 --> 00:04:46.07
that you are the rightful
copyright holder on.

110
00:04:46.07 --> 00:04:50.07
But keep in mind, don't
do this frivolously.

111
00:04:50.07 --> 00:04:54.01
If you start to submit copyright
takedown claims on content

112
00:04:54.01 --> 00:04:58.01
that isn't yours, you can
actually face legal problems.

113
00:04:58.01 --> 00:05:01.05
Copyright violation is something
YouTube takes seriously,

114
00:05:01.05 --> 00:05:02.09
as serious as we can say

115
00:05:02.09 --> 00:05:05.08
that they take no responsibilities for it,

116
00:05:05.08 --> 00:05:07.09
and they're not going to be held liable if

117
00:05:07.09 --> 00:05:09.08
somebody violates someone's copyright,

118
00:05:09.08 --> 00:05:11.07
but they will enforce a takedown

119
00:05:11.07 --> 00:05:15.00
and pull down content that
shouldn't be uploaded.

120
00:05:15.00 --> 00:05:17.09
Additionally, for content that others own,

121
00:05:17.09 --> 00:05:19.07
through the content ID system,

122
00:05:19.07 --> 00:05:21.00
they do pay out money

123
00:05:21.00 --> 00:05:23.03
and damages and loyalties

124
00:05:23.03 --> 00:05:27.01
or revenue from the ads
to those content holders.

125
00:05:27.01 --> 00:05:28.07
So YouTube, as it has matured,

126
00:05:28.07 --> 00:05:31.01
has taken copyright more seriously,

127
00:05:31.01 --> 00:05:33.04
and does try to enforce copyright

128
00:05:33.04 --> 00:05:34.07
and create an environment

129
00:05:34.07 --> 00:05:37.05
where copyright violation doesn't happen.

130
00:05:37.05 --> 00:05:40.08
But with all of those
billions of hours of content,

131
00:05:40.08 --> 00:05:42.07
it's pretty hard to enforce.

132
00:05:42.07 --> 00:05:44.04
So it relies upon a system

133
00:05:44.04 --> 00:05:46.08
of people filing claims when they feel

134
00:05:46.08 --> 00:05:50.00
like their content has
been misused or stolen.

135
00:05:50.00 --> 00:05:52.08
So do keep in mind that YouTube

136
00:05:52.08 --> 00:05:56.04
is a very interesting
quagmire of copyright issues.

137
00:05:56.04 --> 00:05:59.08
And if this is problematic to
your organization or company,

138
00:05:59.08 --> 00:06:01.01
make sure you explore it

139
00:06:01.01 --> 00:06:03.07
and discuss it with a
lawyer before you upload.
