1
00:00:00.04 --> 00:00:02.09
- If you have a lot of
videos to upload to YouTube,

2
00:00:02.09 --> 00:00:06.00
you can load multiple videos at one time.

3
00:00:06.00 --> 00:00:07.04
This could be a big time saver,

4
00:00:07.04 --> 00:00:10.02
particularly if you've been
working and you want to put

5
00:00:10.02 --> 00:00:13.01
several files up and then
walk away for a while.

6
00:00:13.01 --> 00:00:15.07
Your computer can continue
to work in the background,

7
00:00:15.07 --> 00:00:18.09
and this is quite useful
if you save those videos

8
00:00:18.09 --> 00:00:21.08
as being private, and that
way, you can queue them up

9
00:00:21.08 --> 00:00:23.08
and then walk away.

10
00:00:23.08 --> 00:00:26.02
Well, what happens here is
you can take advantage of,

11
00:00:26.02 --> 00:00:28.06
first off, the basic uploader.

12
00:00:28.06 --> 00:00:32.01
This does support adding
multiple videos in,

13
00:00:32.01 --> 00:00:34.08
so it works the same
way as a single upload.

14
00:00:34.08 --> 00:00:37.04
Just drag them in, and once they're there,

15
00:00:37.04 --> 00:00:39.02
you can actually edit the videos

16
00:00:39.02 --> 00:00:42.08
or the metadata all at once.

17
00:00:42.08 --> 00:00:45.02
You can drag multiple videos in the window

18
00:00:45.02 --> 00:00:51.05
or click and select multiple
videos, easy enough.

19
00:00:51.05 --> 00:00:53.06
Once you've done that, as you see here,

20
00:00:53.06 --> 00:00:56.03
they'll just appear one
on top of the other,

21
00:00:56.03 --> 00:00:58.05
so if you upload multiple videos,

22
00:00:58.05 --> 00:01:01.00
you can go through and modify the name

23
00:01:01.00 --> 00:01:03.06
and the description for each.

24
00:01:03.06 --> 00:01:07.09
Now let's go to the upload
screen, and you'll see

25
00:01:07.09 --> 00:01:12.03
I can click the button here
to select multiple files.

26
00:01:12.03 --> 00:01:17.04
I'll choose two videos
here and click choose.

27
00:01:17.04 --> 00:01:21.00
Now in this case, it
will put both videos in.

28
00:01:21.00 --> 00:01:22.05
One of the things that's
going to be interesting

29
00:01:22.05 --> 00:01:25.02
is once YouTube starts to scan this video,

30
00:01:25.02 --> 00:01:28.00
it's going to realize that
I already uploaded it,

31
00:01:28.00 --> 00:01:31.05
so it won't let me upload
it twice to the same channel

32
00:01:31.05 --> 00:01:34.00
unless there's a difference between them.

33
00:01:34.00 --> 00:01:36.09
And here's the second video being queued.

34
00:01:36.09 --> 00:01:40.01
If I click Show more, you see
I can actually start to modify

35
00:01:40.01 --> 00:01:44.02
the description and put
all of that information in.

36
00:01:44.02 --> 00:01:48.09
Remember, you can actually
set this to Private

37
00:01:48.09 --> 00:01:52.05
so nobody sees them and even click Done

38
00:01:52.05 --> 00:01:54.07
so that as the videos finish uploading,

39
00:01:54.07 --> 00:01:56.05
they'll be stored and ready.

40
00:01:56.05 --> 00:01:58.01
This way you don't actually have to wait

41
00:01:58.01 --> 00:02:02.00
for them to finish processing
before you walk away.

42
00:02:02.00 --> 00:02:04.00
Now easy enough, if you change your mind

43
00:02:04.00 --> 00:02:07.02
and you want to stop something,
just click the Cancel button

44
00:02:07.02 --> 00:02:09.00
and you can cancel the upload.

45
00:02:09.00 --> 00:02:11.01
I'll do the same here and you see

46
00:02:11.01 --> 00:02:13.06
that it cancels that individual file.

47
00:02:13.06 --> 00:02:15.06
So it's easy enough, if you want

48
00:02:15.06 --> 00:02:18.03
to put multiple videos in, to do so.

49
00:02:18.03 --> 00:02:21.04
But what about if you
have a lot of content,

50
00:02:21.04 --> 00:02:23.06
hours and hours of content,

51
00:02:23.06 --> 00:02:26.07
a huge channel or multiple channels?

52
00:02:26.07 --> 00:02:28.06
If you are a serious publisher on YouTube,

53
00:02:28.06 --> 00:02:30.08
there are other options.

54
00:02:30.08 --> 00:02:32.07
For example, if you are a member

55
00:02:32.07 --> 00:02:36.02
of the YouTube Partner Program,
not a basic level member,

56
00:02:36.02 --> 00:02:39.09
but you start to get upwards
of 10,000 subscribers,

57
00:02:39.09 --> 00:02:43.04
you will see the option
for offline disk import,

58
00:02:43.04 --> 00:02:45.02
and you'll be able to submit a disk

59
00:02:45.02 --> 00:02:48.00
and mail it to YouTube
for batch uploading.

60
00:02:48.00 --> 00:02:49.05
This can be particularly useful

61
00:02:49.05 --> 00:02:53.00
if you work or live in
a lower-bandwidth area.

62
00:02:53.00 --> 00:02:56.07
Also if you are using Google
AdWords to reach people,

63
00:02:56.07 --> 00:02:59.07
you can actually bulk
upload and use a spreadsheet

64
00:02:59.07 --> 00:03:01.06
through the Google AdWords interface.

65
00:03:01.06 --> 00:03:03.09
A lot of people place video content

66
00:03:03.09 --> 00:03:07.02
and use YouTube for paid
placement or advertisements,

67
00:03:07.02 --> 00:03:09.08
and if you're tying that
or using Google AdWords

68
00:03:09.08 --> 00:03:12.08
to drive traffic to your
videos, you can actually use

69
00:03:12.08 --> 00:03:15.04
the Google AdWords interface
and their bulk uploader

70
00:03:15.04 --> 00:03:19.03
to put up video and text
using a spreadsheet.

71
00:03:19.03 --> 00:03:21.08
And if you are a serious publisher,

72
00:03:21.08 --> 00:03:25.01
one who actually has a lot of
content that is copyrighted,

73
00:03:25.01 --> 00:03:28.01
perhaps a television
network, a record label,

74
00:03:28.01 --> 00:03:30.08
and you've enrolled in
the Content ID program

75
00:03:30.08 --> 00:03:33.03
to legally protect your content, well,

76
00:03:33.03 --> 00:03:35.06
then you're going to see
several different tools.

77
00:03:35.06 --> 00:03:37.07
YouTube does offer a bulk uploader.

78
00:03:37.07 --> 00:03:40.06
They do allow for things like SFTP

79
00:03:40.06 --> 00:03:44.01
so you can actually set up
a folder and upload things

80
00:03:44.01 --> 00:03:47.08
using a transfer tool, or you
can actually take advantage

81
00:03:47.08 --> 00:03:49.09
of that same offline disk import

82
00:03:49.09 --> 00:03:52.08
and just ship in terabytes of information,

83
00:03:52.08 --> 00:03:55.09
and YouTube will take care of it for you.

84
00:03:55.09 --> 00:03:59.02
Now for most of you, the ability
to use the batch uploader

85
00:03:59.02 --> 00:04:01.03
is going to be just fine,
particularly if you're

86
00:04:01.03 --> 00:04:04.01
only publishing 10 videos or so at a time.

87
00:04:04.01 --> 00:04:07.07
But even tools like Adobe
Premiere Pro or Final Cut Pro

88
00:04:07.07 --> 00:04:10.00
have tools built in that allow you

89
00:04:10.00 --> 00:04:12.08
to actually compress the
video and directly publish it

90
00:04:12.08 --> 00:04:15.01
to a YouTube channel, as well.

91
00:04:15.01 --> 00:04:18.04
But if you are doing
high volume publishing

92
00:04:18.04 --> 00:04:21.07
or you have a membership in
the YouTube Partner Program,

93
00:04:21.07 --> 00:04:23.09
make sure you explore
some of the other options

94
00:04:23.09 --> 00:04:25.02
that are available to you.
