1
00:00:00.07 --> 00:00:04.03
- One of the truly useful
tools is the video manager.

2
00:00:04.03 --> 00:00:07.09
This lets you see all of
your videos in an account.

3
00:00:07.09 --> 00:00:11.05
It's great for finding content
or making bulk changes.

4
00:00:11.05 --> 00:00:13.05
With the video manager, we can do things

5
00:00:13.05 --> 00:00:15.08
like actually see everything.

6
00:00:15.08 --> 00:00:17.00
And there are a lot of tools

7
00:00:17.00 --> 00:00:20.03
to sort and sift and find things.

8
00:00:20.03 --> 00:00:24.00
Also, it's going to show
you everything by default.

9
00:00:24.00 --> 00:00:27.05
But it's easy to change that
to see certain privacy settings

10
00:00:27.05 --> 00:00:31.00
like only my private videos or only videos

11
00:00:31.00 --> 00:00:36.01
that have been set to a
creative commons license.

12
00:00:36.01 --> 00:00:38.02
These filter settings are quite useful

13
00:00:38.02 --> 00:00:39.04
so you can find things.

14
00:00:39.04 --> 00:00:42.02
And you can even take a look
at other advanced settings,

15
00:00:42.02 --> 00:00:44.07
searching for things like who uploaded it

16
00:00:44.07 --> 00:00:48.07
or how many views a video has received.

17
00:00:48.07 --> 00:00:53.03
Also what's great is the ability
to control multiple videos.

18
00:00:53.03 --> 00:00:55.03
This allows you to change any setting

19
00:00:55.03 --> 00:00:59.02
for individual videos or a group.

20
00:00:59.02 --> 00:01:01.00
This can be quite useful if you want to

21
00:01:01.00 --> 00:01:05.01
put multiple videos into
a playlist, for example.

22
00:01:05.01 --> 00:01:06.09
Or if you need to add tags,

23
00:01:06.09 --> 00:01:11.08
change categories, or
add age restrictions.

24
00:01:11.08 --> 00:01:15.01
Also, it's a great way
to check the status.

25
00:01:15.01 --> 00:01:18.03
So on each video, you
can see key information

26
00:01:18.03 --> 00:01:22.05
like the privacy, the publication status,

27
00:01:22.05 --> 00:01:26.07
the number of likes,
dislikes, views, and comments,

28
00:01:26.07 --> 00:01:30.09
and as you see here, it
really is total control.

29
00:01:30.09 --> 00:01:35.00
I have the ability to see
exactly all of my videos.

30
00:01:35.00 --> 00:01:38.06
I can see whether or
not they've been shared.

31
00:01:38.06 --> 00:01:41.07
Is a video high definition?

32
00:01:41.07 --> 00:01:45.00
Is a video being monetized?

33
00:01:45.00 --> 00:01:48.02
Is the video scheduled or public?

34
00:01:48.02 --> 00:01:52.00
And this is really quite useful.

35
00:01:52.00 --> 00:01:54.02
In this case, it helps me understand

36
00:01:54.02 --> 00:01:57.02
the status of what I've published.

37
00:01:57.02 --> 00:02:00.02
Let me give you an example
of using the video manager

38
00:02:00.02 --> 00:02:02.07
to make a change to several videos.

39
00:02:02.07 --> 00:02:04.00
I'm going to go to one of my accounts

40
00:02:04.00 --> 00:02:06.07
that has several videos uploaded.

41
00:02:06.07 --> 00:02:09.09
In this case, I've switched
back to the Photofocus account.

42
00:02:09.09 --> 00:02:12.01
And I'm in the video manager.

43
00:02:12.01 --> 00:02:15.06
This is part of the creator studio.

44
00:02:15.06 --> 00:02:19.02
I'm going to tell it that I
want to find certain content.

45
00:02:19.02 --> 00:02:21.05
So under view here, I'm going to click

46
00:02:21.05 --> 00:02:29.03
and say that I want to see
all of my unlisted videos.

47
00:02:29.03 --> 00:02:31.06
You see that it finds my unlisted videos.

48
00:02:31.06 --> 00:02:34.06
And in this case, I've
got a bunch of interviews

49
00:02:34.06 --> 00:02:38.05
and other things that are only
published in certain places.

50
00:02:38.05 --> 00:02:41.04
Well, I want to modify these studio tips.

51
00:02:41.04 --> 00:02:43.09
So I'm going to select
all of the studio tips

52
00:02:43.09 --> 00:02:45.09
that are currently unlisted.

53
00:02:45.09 --> 00:02:48.08
These have been published
to a specific article

54
00:02:48.08 --> 00:02:51.06
on the Photofocus website,
but they're not easy

55
00:02:51.06 --> 00:02:54.02
for other people to see
unless they directly went

56
00:02:54.02 --> 00:02:57.05
to that article because
they're not listed on the page.

57
00:02:57.05 --> 00:03:00.00
So now, I'm going to give
these a broader audience

58
00:03:00.00 --> 00:03:02.03
so they're easier to discover.

59
00:03:02.03 --> 00:03:06.08
What I've done here is selected
all of the studio tips.

60
00:03:06.08 --> 00:03:09.04
And we're going to make these public.

61
00:03:09.04 --> 00:03:11.02
Now, you see that I can go through

62
00:03:11.02 --> 00:03:12.07
and navigate through pages.

63
00:03:12.07 --> 00:03:15.09
In this case I've got two
pages of unlisted videos.

64
00:03:15.09 --> 00:03:17.02
So it's important to switch

65
00:03:17.02 --> 00:03:19.02
and make sure that none were left behind.

66
00:03:19.02 --> 00:03:21.09
And it looks like I found them all there.

67
00:03:21.09 --> 00:03:24.09
So I'll go back

68
00:03:24.09 --> 00:03:28.09
and in this case, with
those videos selected,

69
00:03:28.09 --> 00:03:30.09
notice that it only wants me to be able

70
00:03:30.09 --> 00:03:33.04
to do that on one page at a time.

71
00:03:33.04 --> 00:03:37.01
So if I switch pages,
it lost the selection.

72
00:03:37.01 --> 00:03:40.09
So it's important that you
either fit everything on one page

73
00:03:40.09 --> 00:03:45.01
or you make these changes
in smaller groups.

74
00:03:45.01 --> 00:03:47.09
There we go.

75
00:03:47.09 --> 00:03:50.05
Now what I'm going to do
is make a few changes.

76
00:03:50.05 --> 00:03:52.03
First under actions, I'm going to say

77
00:03:52.03 --> 00:03:56.09
that I want to switch these to public.

78
00:03:56.09 --> 00:04:00.04
And I'm going to update that

79
00:04:00.04 --> 00:04:05.01
and click submit.

80
00:04:05.01 --> 00:04:09.03
Now, as I'm waiting, you'll
notice that I am unable

81
00:04:09.03 --> 00:04:12.00
to do things while that's being edited.

82
00:04:12.00 --> 00:04:14.07
It says pending edit.

83
00:04:14.07 --> 00:04:17.09
So this is going to take a
little bit to find all of those,

84
00:04:17.09 --> 00:04:22.07
but it'll be done in just a moment.

85
00:04:22.07 --> 00:04:24.09
Now they've been updated and are removed

86
00:04:24.09 --> 00:04:27.02
from the unlisted list.

87
00:04:27.02 --> 00:04:29.00
Let's go ahead and search here for things

88
00:04:29.00 --> 00:04:32.01
that have studio tips in the title.

89
00:04:32.01 --> 00:04:35.05
I'll just do a search here

90
00:04:35.05 --> 00:04:38.01
and it found them all.

91
00:04:38.01 --> 00:04:41.08
Now what I'm going to do is
click to select all of those

92
00:04:41.08 --> 00:04:44.01
and I'm going to make another change here.

93
00:04:44.01 --> 00:04:47.04
Under actions, for example,
I can make sure I tell it

94
00:04:47.04 --> 00:04:49.08
that I want to monetize these.

95
00:04:49.08 --> 00:04:53.03
Maybe I want to allow video ads

96
00:04:53.03 --> 00:04:56.03
or sponsored cards.

97
00:04:56.03 --> 00:04:58.03
If I click monetize,

98
00:04:58.03 --> 00:05:01.06
now these videos are able to be monetized.

99
00:05:01.06 --> 00:05:02.09
Now one of the things I noticed

100
00:05:02.09 --> 00:05:06.05
is that the uploader
hasn't been consistent.

101
00:05:06.05 --> 00:05:08.05
Studio tips plural,

102
00:05:08.05 --> 00:05:13.01
studio tips plural with
a colon, studio tip.

103
00:05:13.01 --> 00:05:16.03
Now, this is a great way to
see those sorts of problems.

104
00:05:16.03 --> 00:05:18.05
So what you can actually do is work

105
00:05:18.05 --> 00:05:21.08
with that content if you
needed to make a change.

106
00:05:21.08 --> 00:05:26.03
So you'll see here other
choices including more actions,

107
00:05:26.03 --> 00:05:29.02
which allows you to make
additional changes here.

108
00:05:29.02 --> 00:05:31.02
Do you want to allow
something to be embedded?

109
00:05:31.02 --> 00:05:33.07
Do you want to adjust the title?

110
00:05:33.07 --> 00:05:36.04
So this'll make it easy and I can assign

111
00:05:36.04 --> 00:05:39.08
a new title to all of
these videos if I wanted.

112
00:05:39.08 --> 00:05:40.07
Pretty useful.

113
00:05:40.07 --> 00:05:42.04
Let's go ahead and exit that for a moment.

114
00:05:42.04 --> 00:05:44.04
But with all these videos selected,

115
00:05:44.04 --> 00:05:48.04
what I want to actually do
is add this to a playlist.

116
00:05:48.04 --> 00:05:50.03
So I'm going to click
cancel for a second here

117
00:05:50.03 --> 00:05:52.05
and say add to

118
00:05:52.05 --> 00:05:58.03
and I'm going to make a new
playlist called studio tips

119
00:05:58.03 --> 00:06:01.00
and click create.

120
00:06:01.00 --> 00:06:02.03
And you'll see that those videos

121
00:06:02.03 --> 00:06:08.04
have been added to a playlist.

122
00:06:08.04 --> 00:06:09.09
Add to studio tips.

123
00:06:09.09 --> 00:06:11.00
Great.

124
00:06:11.00 --> 00:06:13.04
Now we do already have
a playlist of that name,

125
00:06:13.04 --> 00:06:16.09
so keep in mind that you might
have a little confusion there

126
00:06:16.09 --> 00:06:19.07
if you have two sets of tips.

127
00:06:19.07 --> 00:06:22.00
So it's important that you control this.

128
00:06:22.00 --> 00:06:24.00
But in any case, you see that the videos

129
00:06:24.00 --> 00:06:27.01
have now been set to monetize and public,

130
00:06:27.01 --> 00:06:30.02
and those global changes have been made.

131
00:06:30.02 --> 00:06:32.09
If I were to go over to
my playlist category here,

132
00:06:32.09 --> 00:06:34.06
I'd be able to see things.

133
00:06:34.06 --> 00:06:37.04
So here we have two sets of videos.

134
00:06:37.04 --> 00:06:41.00
Studio tips, both public and private.

135
00:06:41.00 --> 00:06:42.05
Now in this case, I'm going to get rid

136
00:06:42.05 --> 00:06:44.03
of that new one that I made.

137
00:06:44.03 --> 00:06:46.06
But you see, easy enough, it was able

138
00:06:46.06 --> 00:06:49.07
to put those all into one playlist.

139
00:06:49.07 --> 00:06:52.07
Let's go ahead back for a second.

140
00:06:52.07 --> 00:07:01.05
Let's go ahead and edit that for a second.

141
00:07:01.05 --> 00:07:05.02
And if I want to, I can
actually remove this one

142
00:07:05.02 --> 00:07:07.07
from this particular
playlist and it's done.

143
00:07:07.07 --> 00:07:10.06
Or if needed, I can click
the edit button here

144
00:07:10.06 --> 00:07:13.07
and make additional changes
to this particular playlist

145
00:07:13.07 --> 00:07:16.08
including the settings and other changes.

146
00:07:16.08 --> 00:07:19.00
If you want, click the more button

147
00:07:19.00 --> 00:07:21.03
and this is where you can
get rid of the playlist

148
00:07:21.03 --> 00:07:23.07
or make other global changes.

149
00:07:23.07 --> 00:07:25.05
Now I'm going to kill that
playlist 'cause I actually

150
00:07:25.05 --> 00:07:28.00
have these videos in a playlist already.

151
00:07:28.00 --> 00:07:31.01
But as you can see, this
makes it much easier

152
00:07:31.01 --> 00:07:33.08
to control how videos are being used.

153
00:07:33.08 --> 00:07:36.02
Now that ability to use the video manager

154
00:07:36.02 --> 00:07:39.03
is quite useful and quite powerful.

155
00:07:39.03 --> 00:07:42.01
Remember, you have great search controls

156
00:07:42.01 --> 00:07:45.07
as well as an actions menu
that lets you change things.

157
00:07:45.07 --> 00:07:48.04
As you start to select multiple videos,

158
00:07:48.04 --> 00:07:50.09
that actions menu truly becomes useful

159
00:07:50.09 --> 00:07:54.01
so you can apply global
changes to a list of videos

160
00:07:54.01 --> 00:07:57.00
or use the add to button to organize them

161
00:07:57.00 --> 00:07:58.08
into a playlist for enjoyment.
