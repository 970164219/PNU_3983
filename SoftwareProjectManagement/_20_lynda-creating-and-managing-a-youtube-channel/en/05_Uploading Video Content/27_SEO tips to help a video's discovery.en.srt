1
00:00:00.04 --> 00:00:02.01
- If you're going to publish to YouTube,

2
00:00:02.01 --> 00:00:04.06
you probably want to get
a good number of views,

3
00:00:04.06 --> 00:00:06.02
or at least make sure that your audience

4
00:00:06.02 --> 00:00:07.09
can find your video.

5
00:00:07.09 --> 00:00:11.00
This is where SEO or search
engine optimization comes in,

6
00:00:11.00 --> 00:00:14.07
and I'd like to share with
you a few practical tips

7
00:00:14.07 --> 00:00:17.04
to make your videos more discoverable.

8
00:00:17.04 --> 00:00:20.06
First up, make sure that
you put the important

9
00:00:20.06 --> 00:00:22.05
keywords up front.

10
00:00:22.05 --> 00:00:26.01
So if there's a particular
keyword that's most important,

11
00:00:26.01 --> 00:00:27.06
put it first.

12
00:00:27.06 --> 00:00:29.09
If you're just adding a few extra things,

13
00:00:29.09 --> 00:00:31.02
put it at the end.

14
00:00:31.02 --> 00:00:33.04
Keywords should not be alphabetized.

15
00:00:33.04 --> 00:00:36.09
Rather, put the most important ones early.

16
00:00:36.09 --> 00:00:39.06
Those keywords get more
weight, because they're deemed

17
00:00:39.06 --> 00:00:43.04
to be more significant to the content.

18
00:00:43.04 --> 00:00:47.09
Also, make sure that you
can go ahead and do a search

19
00:00:47.09 --> 00:00:49.03
for those keywords.

20
00:00:49.03 --> 00:00:52.02
So you can do a Google
search or a YouTube search

21
00:00:52.02 --> 00:00:55.09
on a particular keyword
and see if a lot of videos

22
00:00:55.09 --> 00:00:57.07
like yours come up.

23
00:00:57.07 --> 00:01:00.03
By using keywords, it's going to be easier

24
00:01:00.03 --> 00:01:03.02
to find something, so you
should find what works.

25
00:01:03.02 --> 00:01:07.03
So maybe it's HDR or maybe
it's high dynamic range.

26
00:01:07.03 --> 00:01:10.07
Well, see which generates
more hits like the one

27
00:01:10.07 --> 00:01:12.02
that you're trying to get.

28
00:01:12.02 --> 00:01:15.05
Also, the description is critical,

29
00:01:15.05 --> 00:01:17.08
and you have up to 5,000 characters.

30
00:01:17.08 --> 00:01:20.07
With those 5,000 characters,

31
00:01:20.07 --> 00:01:22.09
you can decide how deep you want to go,

32
00:01:22.09 --> 00:01:26.06
but it's generally a good
idea to be descriptive.

33
00:01:26.06 --> 00:01:28.04
Now remember, on mobile devices,

34
00:01:28.04 --> 00:01:30.08
or if the video description is collapsed,

35
00:01:30.08 --> 00:01:33.01
only the first few sentences show,

36
00:01:33.01 --> 00:01:35.05
so put the most important
information where it's

37
00:01:35.05 --> 00:01:38.03
easy to view, but the whole
description does get indexed,

38
00:01:38.03 --> 00:01:42.00
and this will affect
how things are served up

39
00:01:42.00 --> 00:01:45.09
when people search on phrases or keywords.

40
00:01:45.09 --> 00:01:49.09
Additionally, make sure you
consider repeating keywords,

41
00:01:49.09 --> 00:01:52.04
as well as accurately
describing the content

42
00:01:52.04 --> 00:01:53.09
and who's involved.

43
00:01:53.09 --> 00:01:56.08
If you have a particular
host in the video, name it.

44
00:01:56.08 --> 00:01:59.07
If it's a particular
software tool, identify it.

45
00:01:59.07 --> 00:02:00.05
That's what I did.

46
00:02:00.05 --> 00:02:01.05
I named the host.

47
00:02:01.05 --> 00:02:02.07
I named the product.

48
00:02:02.07 --> 00:02:04.07
I named the company behind the product,

49
00:02:04.07 --> 00:02:07.09
and I repeated keywords in my description.

50
00:02:07.09 --> 00:02:11.00
Now, other things to think about include

51
00:02:11.00 --> 00:02:15.00
making sure that the tags can be longer,

52
00:02:15.00 --> 00:02:18.00
so each tag can have up to 120 characters.

53
00:02:18.00 --> 00:02:21.09
What this means is that
you can be more descriptive

54
00:02:21.09 --> 00:02:24.01
on the tag, you don't just
have to use short words.

55
00:02:24.01 --> 00:02:26.07
Compound words might be helpful,

56
00:02:26.07 --> 00:02:29.05
so if you want to describe something as

57
00:02:29.05 --> 00:02:33.05
Asian cooking recipes, well
that might work quite well.

58
00:02:33.05 --> 00:02:37.09
That way you've got all three
words registering as one tag,

59
00:02:37.09 --> 00:02:43.02
and that can be quite useful.

60
00:02:43.02 --> 00:02:46.04
Also, make sure that those
tags or keywords are relevant.

61
00:02:46.04 --> 00:02:48.09
Don't just put a bunch of words in there

62
00:02:48.09 --> 00:02:50.04
to try to weight the results.

63
00:02:50.04 --> 00:02:52.09
They need to be tied
back to the description

64
00:02:52.09 --> 00:02:54.02
and the content.

65
00:02:54.02 --> 00:02:56.07
Put them in order of importance.

66
00:02:56.07 --> 00:03:00.02
The most important ones go first.

67
00:03:00.02 --> 00:03:03.06
And again, make sure you do
a search to see which tags

68
00:03:03.06 --> 00:03:05.09
and keywords show up most frequently.
