1
00:00:00.06 --> 00:00:02.07
- One of the most exciting
additions to YouTube

2
00:00:02.07 --> 00:00:04.08
is the ability to live stream.

3
00:00:04.08 --> 00:00:07.00
This opens up all sorts of great options

4
00:00:07.00 --> 00:00:08.08
for engagement with an audience

5
00:00:08.08 --> 00:00:11.02
whether you're covering a
corporate event, a concert,

6
00:00:11.02 --> 00:00:13.08
or just on-the-go with a mobile device.

7
00:00:13.08 --> 00:00:16.09
Live streaming used to
be tremendously expensive

8
00:00:16.09 --> 00:00:19.01
and it still is with many providers,

9
00:00:19.01 --> 00:00:21.07
but YouTube has democratized this process

10
00:00:21.07 --> 00:00:24.06
making it easy to stream 720p video

11
00:00:24.06 --> 00:00:26.05
or even higher quality video

12
00:00:26.05 --> 00:00:29.03
if you take advantage of
some dedicated hardware.

13
00:00:29.03 --> 00:00:30.07
Now when you go to live stream,

14
00:00:30.07 --> 00:00:33.07
YouTube gives you a few useful options.

15
00:00:33.07 --> 00:00:35.05
You can choose stream now

16
00:00:35.05 --> 00:00:39.01
which just means start sending
out a stream immediately

17
00:00:39.01 --> 00:00:42.01
and this allows you to
send content automatically

18
00:00:42.01 --> 00:00:44.00
and they'll start and stop your stream

19
00:00:44.00 --> 00:00:46.04
as soon as you make the signal available.

20
00:00:46.04 --> 00:00:48.08
Some folks will do this
with screen sharing

21
00:00:48.08 --> 00:00:51.08
or other software tools
or streaming out gaming

22
00:00:51.08 --> 00:00:55.08
or using their web camera
to talk to the world.

23
00:00:55.08 --> 00:00:57.09
You can also schedule events.

24
00:00:57.09 --> 00:00:59.06
This gives you greater control

25
00:00:59.06 --> 00:01:01.04
because you can set a start time

26
00:01:01.04 --> 00:01:04.05
for when you want an
event to start and end

27
00:01:04.05 --> 00:01:09.01
and this could be great
for meetings or webinars.

28
00:01:09.01 --> 00:01:11.05
Additionally, you can do mobile streaming

29
00:01:11.05 --> 00:01:13.09
from the YouTube app.

30
00:01:13.09 --> 00:01:15.06
Once the mobile stream is over,

31
00:01:15.06 --> 00:01:19.08
you simply end it and then
it's archived to your channel.

32
00:01:19.08 --> 00:01:22.08
You also have the ability
after the archive is done

33
00:01:22.08 --> 00:01:26.05
to make this something
that is a private video.

34
00:01:26.05 --> 00:01:28.06
Or you can use a web cam to go live

35
00:01:28.06 --> 00:01:32.00
without even needing an encoder.

36
00:01:32.00 --> 00:01:34.08
Now let's show you these
things really quick.

37
00:01:34.08 --> 00:01:38.04
I'm logged in to the mobile app here

38
00:01:38.04 --> 00:01:40.04
and if I tap the camera icon,

39
00:01:40.04 --> 00:01:44.00
you see I get an ability
here to do one of two things.

40
00:01:44.00 --> 00:01:47.08
I can record the video
and then post it later

41
00:01:47.08 --> 00:01:51.05
or I can tap and go live.

42
00:01:51.05 --> 00:01:52.09
With a simple click here,

43
00:01:52.09 --> 00:01:55.08
I just need to allow access
to some of the controls

44
00:01:55.08 --> 00:01:57.08
on my mobile device

45
00:01:57.08 --> 00:02:05.01
such as giving it access
to the location services.

46
00:02:05.01 --> 00:02:10.04
And you can decide to allow for live chat.

47
00:02:10.04 --> 00:02:13.02
Now it's going to prompt me
to put in some information.

48
00:02:13.02 --> 00:02:17.07
I can also switch from the
forward to the backwards camera.

49
00:02:17.07 --> 00:02:20.06
In this case, I'll just show
you forward for a moment

50
00:02:20.06 --> 00:02:25.09
and I could put in some information.

51
00:02:25.09 --> 00:02:30.07
I'm going to set this to not
be public as an unlisted video

52
00:02:30.07 --> 00:02:37.01
and I can choose a location here.

53
00:02:37.01 --> 00:02:40.04
If I tap more options, you'll
see some other choices here

54
00:02:40.04 --> 00:02:43.09
including the ability to
schedule this for later

55
00:02:43.09 --> 00:02:47.04
where I can type in a specific start time.

56
00:02:47.04 --> 00:02:49.07
Or under advanced settings here,

57
00:02:49.07 --> 00:02:51.03
I've got the ability to decide

58
00:02:51.03 --> 00:02:53.09
if I want to allow people to chat,

59
00:02:53.09 --> 00:02:56.02
if this video should be age restricted,

60
00:02:56.02 --> 00:02:57.07
whether or not it's promotion,

61
00:02:57.07 --> 00:03:01.04
and if we want monetization on the video.

62
00:03:01.04 --> 00:03:08.05
I'll go back from the advanced
settings here and tap next.

63
00:03:08.05 --> 00:03:11.00
It counts me down,

64
00:03:11.00 --> 00:03:13.02
takes the thumbnail for the video.

65
00:03:13.02 --> 00:03:15.06
I know the shot of the desk
is not very interesting,

66
00:03:15.06 --> 00:03:17.06
but you get the idea

67
00:03:17.06 --> 00:03:21.04
and we tap go live.

68
00:03:21.04 --> 00:03:24.03
Now I'm sending out a live stream.

69
00:03:24.03 --> 00:03:25.07
We did not make this public

70
00:03:25.07 --> 00:03:28.03
so I don't expect anybody to join,

71
00:03:28.03 --> 00:03:29.04
but you'll notice here

72
00:03:29.04 --> 00:03:32.08
that I can flip around to the front camera

73
00:03:32.08 --> 00:03:35.04
and we're sending out a live stream.

74
00:03:35.04 --> 00:03:39.03
We can start to enhance the video.

75
00:03:39.03 --> 00:03:41.06
Or if I tap the more icon here,

76
00:03:41.06 --> 00:03:45.01
you see that we can actually
share this out socially

77
00:03:45.01 --> 00:03:49.01
so I can tell people,
"Hey, join me on Twitter,"

78
00:03:49.01 --> 00:03:51.06
or maybe I copy the link
and put it out there.

79
00:03:51.06 --> 00:03:54.00
So even though it's an unlisted video,

80
00:03:54.00 --> 00:03:55.04
you can actually take advantage

81
00:03:55.04 --> 00:04:00.03
of different sharing services
to put this in more places.

82
00:04:00.03 --> 00:04:09.04
I'll go ahead and share
this to Twitter for a moment

83
00:04:09.04 --> 00:04:12.09
and you see inside of our studio
as we're making the video.

84
00:04:12.09 --> 00:04:14.04
Now we have two viewers.

85
00:04:14.04 --> 00:04:16.07
So you see this does actually work.

86
00:04:16.07 --> 00:04:18.01
Three viewers, hello three viewers.

87
00:04:18.01 --> 00:04:19.03
We're doing a test stream here,

88
00:04:19.03 --> 00:04:22.06
walking people through how
YouTube live streaming works

89
00:04:22.06 --> 00:04:24.08
so we're able to actually send this out

90
00:04:24.08 --> 00:04:26.04
and you should be hearing me.

91
00:04:26.04 --> 00:04:27.07
Now viewers have the ability

92
00:04:27.07 --> 00:04:29.05
to click a thumbs up if they want

93
00:04:29.05 --> 00:04:31.04
to indicate that they agree

94
00:04:31.04 --> 00:04:32.06
or that they're hearing the video.

95
00:04:32.06 --> 00:04:34.00
They can like the video.

96
00:04:34.00 --> 00:04:36.09
And we actually have the
ability here if we want

97
00:04:36.09 --> 00:04:41.01
to see other options so I
can turn on chat right now.

98
00:04:41.01 --> 00:04:44.00
If people were to send any
messages, they would appear.

99
00:04:44.00 --> 00:04:45.09
So there's a hi, thank you.

100
00:04:45.09 --> 00:04:46.09
So we've got an overlay.

101
00:04:46.09 --> 00:04:49.03
So I can actually see
things from the audience.

102
00:04:49.03 --> 00:04:52.04
They can ask questions and
engage in the middle here.

103
00:04:52.04 --> 00:04:54.05
Now the live streaming is just one option.

104
00:04:54.05 --> 00:04:55.08
Thank you guys for tuning into that.

105
00:04:55.08 --> 00:04:59.03
I'm going to go ahead and close that

106
00:04:59.03 --> 00:05:01.08
and I'll click end.

107
00:05:01.08 --> 00:05:03.09
Now the video is uploaded

108
00:05:03.09 --> 00:05:05.06
and you can see a little bit of statistics

109
00:05:05.06 --> 00:05:07.01
about what happened.

110
00:05:07.01 --> 00:05:10.02
When I click done, it's all there

111
00:05:10.02 --> 00:05:13.08
and you'll see that it
becomes a draft post loaded

112
00:05:13.08 --> 00:05:15.02
waiting to be used.

113
00:05:15.02 --> 00:05:18.00
So the stream is there
and it proceeds to upload

114
00:05:18.00 --> 00:05:20.02
and becomes available.

115
00:05:20.02 --> 00:05:24.05
This is an easy way to live
stream from your mobile device.

116
00:05:24.05 --> 00:05:26.08
Additionally, besides
using the live stream,

117
00:05:26.08 --> 00:05:28.09
you have the ability to use a webcam.

118
00:05:28.09 --> 00:05:30.08
Many laptops have it built in

119
00:05:30.08 --> 00:05:33.02
or something as simple as a webcam

120
00:05:33.02 --> 00:05:36.00
plugged in to your USB
port is going to work.

121
00:05:36.00 --> 00:05:40.04
This is a great way to webcast
from just about any computer.

122
00:05:40.04 --> 00:05:43.02
Now this is going to give you
the ability to send out signals

123
00:05:43.02 --> 00:05:45.00
and if you need higher quality cameras,

124
00:05:45.00 --> 00:05:48.05
one of the devices that I use
is this device from Blackmagic

125
00:05:48.05 --> 00:05:51.04
called the Blackmagic
Design Web Presenter.

126
00:05:51.04 --> 00:05:53.07
This lets you plug in two sources,

127
00:05:53.07 --> 00:05:55.04
one via HDMI,

128
00:05:55.04 --> 00:05:59.05
one via HD STI, a
professional video connection.

129
00:05:59.05 --> 00:06:03.05
This will make it quite easy
for you to send out a signal

130
00:06:03.05 --> 00:06:06.03
and it turns any professional
camera and microphone

131
00:06:06.03 --> 00:06:08.07
into a web camera that works with YouTube.
