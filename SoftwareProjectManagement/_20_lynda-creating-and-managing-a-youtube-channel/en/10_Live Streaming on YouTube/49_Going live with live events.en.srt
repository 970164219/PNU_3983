1
00:00:00.05 --> 00:00:03.03
- One of the easiest ways
to go live is with an event.

2
00:00:03.03 --> 00:00:05.07
And the easiest way to
do this completely is

3
00:00:05.07 --> 00:00:07.06
with the Hangouts On Air engine

4
00:00:07.06 --> 00:00:09.05
that used to be part of Google Plus.

5
00:00:09.05 --> 00:00:10.06
Now Hangouts On Air,

6
00:00:10.06 --> 00:00:13.05
also known as YouTube
Live are pretty simple.

7
00:00:13.05 --> 00:00:17.02
You go to the Live Streaming
section in your Creator Studio

8
00:00:17.02 --> 00:00:20.09
and you click on New live event.

9
00:00:20.09 --> 00:00:25.07
Then, choose Quick using
Google Hangouts On Air.

10
00:00:25.07 --> 00:00:29.08
Give your live stream a
title and click Go live now

11
00:00:29.08 --> 00:00:32.05
if you want to immediately
start broadcasting.

12
00:00:32.05 --> 00:00:36.00
Or you can enter in
details to schedule it.

13
00:00:36.00 --> 00:00:38.04
Then you use the Google
Hangouts engine to do

14
00:00:38.04 --> 00:00:41.06
a live broadcast which can
include multiple panelists

15
00:00:41.06 --> 00:00:44.01
and guests as well as screen sharing.

16
00:00:44.01 --> 00:00:46.05
Now, I use this sometimes
to do live events

17
00:00:46.05 --> 00:00:49.00
on photofocus where we
teach people software

18
00:00:49.00 --> 00:00:50.09
with guest experts.

19
00:00:50.09 --> 00:00:54.00
As you can see here, it's
easy to schedule it in advance

20
00:00:54.00 --> 00:00:57.02
and then during the webinar,
multiple people can join us

21
00:00:57.02 --> 00:01:01.06
for the conversation as
we take a look at tools.

22
00:01:01.06 --> 00:01:05.00
It even has great tools for
putting things like lower thirds

23
00:01:05.00 --> 00:01:07.08
or graphics over the top,
so as you're teaching,

24
00:01:07.08 --> 00:01:12.00
people can see who's talking
and what's happening.

25
00:01:12.00 --> 00:01:15.07
To schedule a live broadcast,
it's pretty straight forward

26
00:01:15.07 --> 00:01:19.03
Make sure you take advantage
of the built in scheduler.

27
00:01:19.03 --> 00:01:23.02
And this can also control
who can see a broadcast.

28
00:01:23.02 --> 00:01:26.01
Is it public, unlisted, et cetera.

29
00:01:26.01 --> 00:01:28.08
When you create the event,
you have a few options.

30
00:01:28.08 --> 00:01:32.07
Public means anyone can
find it and watch it.

31
00:01:32.07 --> 00:01:35.04
Unlisted means it's not shown publicly,

32
00:01:35.04 --> 00:01:38.05
but if you put the link out
there via social media, a blog,

33
00:01:38.05 --> 00:01:40.07
or email, people can find it.

34
00:01:40.07 --> 00:01:44.08
I'll sometimes use unlisted
for smaller meeting or events

35
00:01:44.08 --> 00:01:46.05
that I want people to be at

36
00:01:46.05 --> 00:01:49.00
but I don't want to
publicize quite largely.

37
00:01:49.00 --> 00:01:50.09
This way I can email the link around

38
00:01:50.09 --> 00:01:52.07
and people can watch and view.

39
00:01:52.07 --> 00:01:54.07
If I'm really concerned
about who's attending,

40
00:01:54.07 --> 00:01:56.09
well then I can set that event to private.

41
00:01:56.09 --> 00:01:58.00
A private event means

42
00:01:58.00 --> 00:02:01.02
that only people you've
specifically invited

43
00:02:01.02 --> 00:02:05.09
by an email address or a web
domain or a particular group

44
00:02:05.09 --> 00:02:09.05
that you've set up, can
see the live broadcast.

45
00:02:09.05 --> 00:02:12.01
To access a live broadcast is easy.

46
00:02:12.01 --> 00:02:17.05
Just log into your channel
and go to Creator Studio.

47
00:02:17.05 --> 00:02:23.05
Then, click on Live Streaming.

48
00:02:23.05 --> 00:02:27.03
If you want to go live
now, click on Stream Now

49
00:02:27.03 --> 00:02:31.04
and you'll see here that you
have the ability to go live.

50
00:02:31.04 --> 00:02:35.02
You simply put in some general information

51
00:02:35.02 --> 00:02:38.08
and from Stream Options here,
you can decide what to do.

52
00:02:38.08 --> 00:02:42.00
This means for example,
that we can stream this

53
00:02:42.00 --> 00:02:43.03
and then make an archive.

54
00:02:43.03 --> 00:02:48.03
We can stream it and allow
people to have rewind, et cetera.

55
00:02:48.03 --> 00:02:51.02
We'll talk more about these
options in just a moment.

56
00:02:51.02 --> 00:02:53.00
Now, what I want to suggest is

57
00:02:53.00 --> 00:02:56.06
that you use the Events section.

58
00:02:56.06 --> 00:02:59.06
This is going to give you more control.

59
00:02:59.06 --> 00:03:03.01
Click to make a new live event.

60
00:03:03.01 --> 00:03:07.07
Then, enter a title.

61
00:03:07.07 --> 00:03:10.01
You can choose to go live now

62
00:03:10.01 --> 00:03:15.09
or set this for a specific time.

63
00:03:15.09 --> 00:03:19.03
You can also add an end time.

64
00:03:19.03 --> 00:03:26.00
Feel free to put in a description.

65
00:03:26.00 --> 00:03:34.02
And tags.

66
00:03:34.02 --> 00:03:38.09
You can decide the publicity
status, and decide on a method.

67
00:03:38.09 --> 00:03:41.00
The easiest one is the Quick method

68
00:03:41.00 --> 00:03:43.05
with the Google's Hangout On Air.

69
00:03:43.05 --> 00:03:46.04
Once I create the event,
a new video is made

70
00:03:46.04 --> 00:03:49.06
that's designed to be a
container for the live stream.

71
00:03:49.06 --> 00:03:51.03
If we scroll down here to the bottom,

72
00:03:51.03 --> 00:03:54.06
you see that it's got the
date and the information.

73
00:03:54.06 --> 00:03:58.01
If people were to go to that
page or I was to embed this

74
00:03:58.01 --> 00:04:02.06
into a webpage, it would look
just like a YouTube video.

75
00:04:02.06 --> 00:04:05.01
But in the mean time,
it's got a countdown timer

76
00:04:05.01 --> 00:04:08.05
until the event starts or
they can click set a reminder

77
00:04:08.05 --> 00:04:11.06
and get notified when the event begins.

78
00:04:11.06 --> 00:04:14.02
Now there's more to running
a Google Hangout On Air

79
00:04:14.02 --> 00:04:16.03
and I invite you to check
out some of the courses

80
00:04:16.03 --> 00:04:18.07
in our library about webinars and events

81
00:04:18.07 --> 00:04:21.06
or some of the documentation
on Google's website.

82
00:04:21.06 --> 00:04:24.09
But the Hangout On Air
engine is the easiest way

83
00:04:24.09 --> 00:04:26.08
to do a live video stream.

84
00:04:26.08 --> 00:04:29.07
But there are other methods
and we'll talk about that next.
