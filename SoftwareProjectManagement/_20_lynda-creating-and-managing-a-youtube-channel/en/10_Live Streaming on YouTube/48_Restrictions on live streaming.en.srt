1
00:00:00.00 --> 00:00:03.01
- Now, just because you have
access to live streaming

2
00:00:03.01 --> 00:00:06.04
doesn't mean you can live
stream every piece of content.

3
00:00:06.04 --> 00:00:08.04
This is a relatively expensive service

4
00:00:08.04 --> 00:00:10.02
for Google to offer for free,

5
00:00:10.02 --> 00:00:12.04
so they do place some limitations.

6
00:00:12.04 --> 00:00:13.09
If you want to live stream,

7
00:00:13.09 --> 00:00:16.03
you have to make sure that your account

8
00:00:16.03 --> 00:00:18.07
is in good standing,
and it will be disabled

9
00:00:18.07 --> 00:00:21.05
if you do any of the following things.

10
00:00:21.05 --> 00:00:23.06
If you get a Community Guideline strike

11
00:00:23.06 --> 00:00:25.08
for offensive content,
you're going to lose

12
00:00:25.08 --> 00:00:29.01
the ability to stream,
at least for a while.

13
00:00:29.01 --> 00:00:32.04
If your live stream is blocked globally

14
00:00:32.04 --> 00:00:34.08
because of offensive
content after the fact,

15
00:00:34.08 --> 00:00:37.01
and they discover a video
that you live streamed

16
00:00:37.01 --> 00:00:40.00
that they feel violates
the Community Guidelines,

17
00:00:40.00 --> 00:00:42.09
well, then you're going to be blocked.

18
00:00:42.09 --> 00:00:46.06
And if your live stream
or an archive live stream

19
00:00:46.06 --> 00:00:50.01
receives a copyright takedown
notice for a violation,

20
00:00:50.01 --> 00:00:52.03
well, you're going to be blocked.

21
00:00:52.03 --> 00:00:54.01
And if your live stream matches

22
00:00:54.01 --> 00:00:55.08
a copyrighted live broadcast,

23
00:00:55.08 --> 00:00:57.07
like you point your live camera

24
00:00:57.07 --> 00:00:59.03
at the big Pay-Per-View fight

25
00:00:59.03 --> 00:01:00.08
and start live streaming it,

26
00:01:00.08 --> 00:01:02.03
you're going to be blocked.

27
00:01:02.03 --> 00:01:04.09
What this comes down to
is YouTube doesn't want

28
00:01:04.09 --> 00:01:06.09
to give live streaming ability to people

29
00:01:06.09 --> 00:01:09.00
that are going to use
it for hateful things

30
00:01:09.00 --> 00:01:11.02
or to steal other people's work.

31
00:01:11.02 --> 00:01:14.08
Now, if you are violating
copyright accidentally,

32
00:01:14.08 --> 00:01:17.04
they pick up something that's
registered with content ID

33
00:01:17.04 --> 00:01:20.00
like background music that's copyrighted,

34
00:01:20.00 --> 00:01:22.07
YouTube will pop up a warning
during your live stream

35
00:01:22.07 --> 00:01:25.05
to let you know that
you're violating copyright.

36
00:01:25.05 --> 00:01:26.08
But if you keep doing this,

37
00:01:26.08 --> 00:01:29.04
particularly for things
like live sporting events

38
00:01:29.04 --> 00:01:31.06
or rebroadcasting television,

39
00:01:31.06 --> 00:01:35.03
you're going to have problems
with your live stream.

40
00:01:35.03 --> 00:01:38.02
Now, the restrictions are
going to last for 90 days

41
00:01:38.02 --> 00:01:43.01
or until you fix the issues
that were in violation.

42
00:01:43.01 --> 00:01:46.02
You can check your status by
going under the Channel menu

43
00:01:46.02 --> 00:01:48.03
and look at Status, and
you'll be able to see

44
00:01:48.03 --> 00:01:51.08
if a feature is enabled or disabled.

45
00:01:51.08 --> 00:01:55.01
If you are deemed to be broadcasting live

46
00:01:55.01 --> 00:01:57.00
something that is copyrighted,

47
00:01:57.00 --> 00:01:59.03
that cannot be appealed.

48
00:01:59.03 --> 00:02:02.02
They will just simply
block you automatically

49
00:02:02.02 --> 00:02:05.03
as a copyright violator.

50
00:02:05.03 --> 00:02:07.05
Remember, it is against
the Terms of Service

51
00:02:07.05 --> 00:02:10.01
to use third-party ads in a live stream,

52
00:02:10.01 --> 00:02:12.05
including burned-in commercials.

53
00:02:12.05 --> 00:02:13.09
So if you're doing an event

54
00:02:13.09 --> 00:02:16.09
and you've got your own
commercials you want to play back,

55
00:02:16.09 --> 00:02:19.02
maybe it's a local sporting
event for a high school

56
00:02:19.02 --> 00:02:22.08
and you've sold commercials
to the local businesses,

57
00:02:22.08 --> 00:02:25.03
well, you can't play those back.

58
00:02:25.03 --> 00:02:28.00
This means that YouTube wants control

59
00:02:28.00 --> 00:02:29.02
over the advertisements.

60
00:02:29.02 --> 00:02:31.02
They don't want you selling your own ads

61
00:02:31.02 --> 00:02:32.07
and putting 'em on YouTube.

62
00:02:32.07 --> 00:02:35.08
Rather, you have to use their ad engine

63
00:02:35.08 --> 00:02:37.07
and play by their rules.
