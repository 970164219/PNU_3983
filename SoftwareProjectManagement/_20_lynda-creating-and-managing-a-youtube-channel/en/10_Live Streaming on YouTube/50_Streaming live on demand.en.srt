1
00:00:00.05 --> 00:00:02.03
- If you've moved beyond streaming

2
00:00:02.03 --> 00:00:04.02
with a simple mobile device

3
00:00:04.02 --> 00:00:06.01
or the Google Hangouts On Air engine,

4
00:00:06.01 --> 00:00:07.05
you can actually use YouTube

5
00:00:07.05 --> 00:00:09.05
as a pretty viable platform for streaming.

6
00:00:09.05 --> 00:00:12.01
You will need some software or hardware

7
00:00:12.01 --> 00:00:14.02
in order to pull this off,

8
00:00:14.02 --> 00:00:15.09
and I'm just going to
give you a small taste

9
00:00:15.09 --> 00:00:17.02
of what's involved.

10
00:00:17.02 --> 00:00:19.06
I invite you check out some
of the full-length courses

11
00:00:19.06 --> 00:00:21.08
on webinars and streaming in the library.

12
00:00:21.08 --> 00:00:26.00
Now, in order to stream on
demand, it's pretty simple.

13
00:00:26.00 --> 00:00:29.03
When YouTube detects that you
have put out a live signal

14
00:00:29.03 --> 00:00:32.04
to the channel, it will
go live, and it will

15
00:00:32.04 --> 00:00:35.02
actually send this out and
automatically adjust the quality

16
00:00:35.02 --> 00:00:38.01
of the stream based upon
people's internet connection,

17
00:00:38.01 --> 00:00:39.05
so if they have a slower connection

18
00:00:39.05 --> 00:00:41.06
like a mobile device, it will adjust.

19
00:00:41.06 --> 00:00:44.00
When the stream is live,

20
00:00:44.00 --> 00:00:48.04
people can actually interact
using live chat or Super Chat.

21
00:00:48.04 --> 00:00:51.02
They can also share the
link like any other video

22
00:00:51.02 --> 00:00:54.03
across social media platforms,

23
00:00:54.03 --> 00:00:57.04
and you can monitor the stream,
looking at the status bar,

24
00:00:57.04 --> 00:00:58.07
to see how it's doing.

25
00:00:58.07 --> 00:01:01.01
Are there any bandwidth problems?

26
00:01:01.01 --> 00:01:02.05
Now, in order to pull this off,

27
00:01:02.05 --> 00:01:04.04
you're going to need some software.

28
00:01:04.04 --> 00:01:07.07
One of the most common ones
is Open Broadcaster Studio,

29
00:01:07.07 --> 00:01:09.09
which is a free tool available.

30
00:01:09.09 --> 00:01:13.08
If you visit obsproject.com,
there's a wealth of tutorials

31
00:01:13.08 --> 00:01:16.00
and documentation, and this allows you

32
00:01:16.00 --> 00:01:19.04
to set up complex
studios on your computer.

33
00:01:19.04 --> 00:01:21.03
You could actually have multiple inputs,

34
00:01:21.03 --> 00:01:24.02
multiple screens, picture-in-picture
effects, graphics.

35
00:01:24.02 --> 00:01:27.04
It's really quite powerful, and
free free to check this out,

36
00:01:27.04 --> 00:01:31.06
as it allows you to do a
very rich mobile broadcast.

37
00:01:31.06 --> 00:01:33.09
If you're looking for a paid tool, well,

38
00:01:33.09 --> 00:01:35.05
then take a look at Wirecast,

39
00:01:35.05 --> 00:01:38.00
which is a well-rounded
solution that's been around

40
00:01:38.00 --> 00:01:43.02
for many years and makes it
easy to do live broadcasting.

41
00:01:43.02 --> 00:01:45.04
Now, I'm a big fan of OBS Studio.

42
00:01:45.04 --> 00:01:46.03
It makes it easy

43
00:01:46.03 --> 00:01:49.03
to get my content out
there, and it's free.

44
00:01:49.03 --> 00:01:53.04
They also have excellent
documentation and support forums.

45
00:01:53.04 --> 00:01:56.00
Once you've installed
it, it's pretty easy,

46
00:01:56.00 --> 00:02:00.05
and you simply go through
and add different sources.

47
00:02:00.05 --> 00:02:02.02
You'll notice here, for example, that not

48
00:02:02.02 --> 00:02:04.09
only can you use different local devices,

49
00:02:04.09 --> 00:02:08.04
but you can load in
graphics or other sources

50
00:02:08.04 --> 00:02:10.07
or a video capture device like a webcam

51
00:02:10.07 --> 00:02:15.07
or the Blackmagic Design Web Presenter.

52
00:02:15.07 --> 00:02:17.04
Then, it's pretty simple.

53
00:02:17.04 --> 00:02:20.08
You switch over to your streaming channel.

54
00:02:20.08 --> 00:02:25.06
Select the live stream
option, and click Get Started.

55
00:02:25.06 --> 00:02:27.07
Type in the details about the stream

56
00:02:27.07 --> 00:02:31.07
and whether or not you
want it public or private.

57
00:02:31.07 --> 00:02:34.09
Click Reveal at the bottom of the page.

58
00:02:34.09 --> 00:02:36.01
This is very important,

59
00:02:36.01 --> 00:02:38.08
and I'll show you it in just a moment.

60
00:02:38.08 --> 00:02:42.07
Then, highlight the
stream key and copy it.

61
00:02:42.07 --> 00:02:45.06
You need this, because the
Open Broadcasting software

62
00:02:45.06 --> 00:02:48.08
or Wirecast is going to
need this key in order

63
00:02:48.08 --> 00:02:52.00
to access your YouTube channel.

64
00:02:52.00 --> 00:02:57.01
Copy that key, and then
paste it into your software.

65
00:02:57.01 --> 00:02:58.07
Then, in the software,

66
00:02:58.07 --> 00:03:02.06
get it all set up and start to stream.

67
00:03:02.06 --> 00:03:05.09
Choose YouTube as the provider,
and put the stream key

68
00:03:05.09 --> 00:03:08.04
in so it knows how to access it.

69
00:03:08.04 --> 00:03:10.05
This is going to connect your computer

70
00:03:10.05 --> 00:03:13.04
to YouTube for the live stream.

71
00:03:13.04 --> 00:03:14.06
Click the Start button,

72
00:03:14.06 --> 00:03:17.08
and you should now be broadcasting live.

73
00:03:17.08 --> 00:03:20.01
Back in the web browser,
the status will change

74
00:03:20.01 --> 00:03:23.04
to online, and your live
stream will be available.

75
00:03:23.04 --> 00:03:25.01
Let me show you how this works.

76
00:03:25.01 --> 00:03:27.00
It's really pretty straightforward.

77
00:03:27.00 --> 00:03:29.08
It just has a lot of steps,
so I'll try to go slow.

78
00:03:29.08 --> 00:03:32.05
In YouTube, simply make sure

79
00:03:32.05 --> 00:03:37.05
you're visiting your Creator Studio.

80
00:03:37.05 --> 00:03:42.06
Then, go to Live Streaming,
and choose Stream now.

81
00:03:42.06 --> 00:03:46.06
You'll now see a simple
checklist to follow.

82
00:03:46.06 --> 00:03:49.06
I'll click Set up encoding software,

83
00:03:49.06 --> 00:03:55.04
and it's got some interesting information.

84
00:03:55.04 --> 00:03:58.00
I can also get information
about the stream

85
00:03:58.00 --> 00:03:59.07
and take advantage of other features,

86
00:03:59.07 --> 00:04:02.03
so there's lots of great articles here.

87
00:04:02.03 --> 00:04:03.08
Let's go ahead and leave this

88
00:04:03.08 --> 00:04:06.00
as is, Photofocus Live Stream.

89
00:04:06.00 --> 00:04:08.05
This is only a test.

90
00:04:08.05 --> 00:04:10.00
I'm not going to worry about categories,

91
00:04:10.00 --> 00:04:12.02
but you can decide where it gets mapped

92
00:04:12.02 --> 00:04:15.04
and what is the privacy setting.

93
00:04:15.04 --> 00:04:17.00
There we go.

94
00:04:17.00 --> 00:04:21.02
I'll make this one unlisted for now.

95
00:04:21.02 --> 00:04:24.00
Under Advanced settings, there
are lots of other controls

96
00:04:24.00 --> 00:04:26.05
that you can access, and you'll see here

97
00:04:26.05 --> 00:04:29.06
that you can decide how you want to chat,

98
00:04:29.06 --> 00:04:31.05
copyrights, and other options,

99
00:04:31.05 --> 00:04:34.02
and whether or not it's allowed to embed.

100
00:04:34.02 --> 00:04:36.02
These options are very much like some

101
00:04:36.02 --> 00:04:38.02
of the things you saw before for a video,

102
00:04:38.02 --> 00:04:41.00
but I do recommend that
you tell it to record

103
00:04:41.00 --> 00:04:45.06
and archive as well as
decide if you want comments.

104
00:04:45.06 --> 00:04:48.03
The DVR option will
allow people to rewind,

105
00:04:48.03 --> 00:04:51.09
and you can even set the
quality of the stream.

106
00:04:51.09 --> 00:04:54.05
For example, we can do
higher quality streaming,

107
00:04:54.05 --> 00:04:56.07
but it's going to have more of a lag.

108
00:04:56.07 --> 00:04:58.00
And so take a look

109
00:04:58.00 --> 00:05:01.05
at these advanced options
for additional control.

110
00:05:01.05 --> 00:05:05.04
I'll click Save changes here.

111
00:05:05.04 --> 00:05:09.03
Now, let's go back to the
basic info for a moment,

112
00:05:09.03 --> 00:05:13.08
and I've got the option
here selected for custom.

113
00:05:13.08 --> 00:05:16.06
Now, let's go back to
Stream now for a moment,

114
00:05:16.06 --> 00:05:19.06
and you'll see some of the key info.

115
00:05:19.06 --> 00:05:21.06
We've got our general options.

116
00:05:21.06 --> 00:05:25.09
I see that I have Super Chat,
and here's my encoder setup.

117
00:05:25.09 --> 00:05:27.07
Well, this is really important here.

118
00:05:27.07 --> 00:05:31.08
I'm going to reveal that and copy it.

119
00:05:31.08 --> 00:05:35.06
Later on, we can reset this
so people can't see it,

120
00:05:35.06 --> 00:05:37.03
and it will change out the key.

121
00:05:37.03 --> 00:05:40.07
Here's also the URL
for sharing this video.

122
00:05:40.07 --> 00:05:42.09
Now that I've got that
key, I need to switch

123
00:05:42.09 --> 00:05:44.07
to Open Broadcaster Studio,

124
00:05:44.07 --> 00:05:47.06
and let's add a new device for Source.

125
00:05:47.06 --> 00:05:54.01
I'll choose Video Capture Device,

126
00:05:54.01 --> 00:05:59.02
and choose this from the
preset list for the USB camera.

127
00:05:59.02 --> 00:06:02.00
My camera turns on, and there's my video.

128
00:06:02.00 --> 00:06:02.08
Hi.

129
00:06:02.08 --> 00:06:05.00
Let's adjust the angle a little bit.

130
00:06:05.00 --> 00:06:09.00
Now, I'll turn on the
camera, and it's available,

131
00:06:09.00 --> 00:06:10.09
and I can adjust the camera slightly

132
00:06:10.09 --> 00:06:13.03
or mount this at a better
angle so it's not shooting up

133
00:06:13.03 --> 00:06:15.06
to the ceiling, but
for purposes of a test,

134
00:06:15.06 --> 00:06:17.02
this is going to work.

135
00:06:17.02 --> 00:06:18.01
You'll notice that you could

136
00:06:18.01 --> 00:06:22.01
also choose a quality setting
depending upon your camera,

137
00:06:22.01 --> 00:06:24.07
and I'm going to click OK.

138
00:06:24.07 --> 00:06:27.04
Now, it's actually seeing
it, but what's not coming

139
00:06:27.04 --> 00:06:30.03
through is the audio
yet, so I need to click

140
00:06:30.03 --> 00:06:35.01
to add an audio source,
Audio Input Capture.

141
00:06:35.01 --> 00:06:37.04
I'll click OK and tell it

142
00:06:37.04 --> 00:06:42.05
to use the built-in
microphone or my webcam.

143
00:06:42.05 --> 00:06:44.04
There we go.

144
00:06:44.04 --> 00:06:47.04
So now we've got our different sources.

145
00:06:47.04 --> 00:06:48.05
Let's go ahead and click here

146
00:06:48.05 --> 00:06:57.04
and choose Audio Input Capture,

147
00:06:57.04 --> 00:07:03.03
and we'll select our source and click OK.

148
00:07:03.03 --> 00:07:06.04
So now, I've got audio and video.

149
00:07:06.04 --> 00:07:09.06
Now, this allows us to get
the general content in,

150
00:07:09.06 --> 00:07:12.03
and what I'm going to
do next is set this up,

151
00:07:12.03 --> 00:07:15.05
so I'll simply run the wizard here,

152
00:07:15.05 --> 00:07:19.07
Tools, Auto-Configuration Wizard,

153
00:07:19.07 --> 00:07:24.05
and let's step through the options.

154
00:07:24.05 --> 00:07:29.00
I'm going to tell it that the
main purpose is to stream.

155
00:07:29.00 --> 00:07:31.00
And what do I want it to use?

156
00:07:31.00 --> 00:07:34.02
Well, the resolution's fine.

157
00:07:34.02 --> 00:07:36.02
Set the frame rate.

158
00:07:36.02 --> 00:07:38.02
Click Next.

159
00:07:38.02 --> 00:07:41.09
I can now choose which
streaming service to use,

160
00:07:41.09 --> 00:07:45.07
such as YouTube, and I can paste that key

161
00:07:45.07 --> 00:07:51.01
in there, and I'll click Next.

162
00:07:51.01 --> 00:07:54.00
Now, it's going to take a moment
as it analyzes the settings

163
00:07:54.00 --> 00:07:59.00
and attempts to configure.

164
00:07:59.00 --> 00:08:00.03
There we go.

165
00:08:00.03 --> 00:08:06.04
I'll click Apply Settings,

166
00:08:06.04 --> 00:08:10.02
and we now have a live signal with video,

167
00:08:10.02 --> 00:08:12.03
and in fact, I can see the studio here.

168
00:08:12.03 --> 00:08:16.05
Later on, I can load more
than one source up here,

169
00:08:16.05 --> 00:08:19.05
and this can be quite useful.

170
00:08:19.05 --> 00:08:24.02
All right, let's go head over
to YouTube and take this live.

171
00:08:24.02 --> 00:08:26.07
In this case, I'm sending out a signal,

172
00:08:26.07 --> 00:08:31.01
and I'll click Start Streaming.

173
00:08:31.01 --> 00:08:34.06
You see the green light
indicating that it's there.

174
00:08:34.06 --> 00:08:37.06
Now, if we switch back over,

175
00:08:37.06 --> 00:08:40.04
you see that the stream health is solid.

176
00:08:40.04 --> 00:08:44.06
It says that my content
is there, and I am live,

177
00:08:44.06 --> 00:08:48.08
so now we are sending a signal,

178
00:08:48.08 --> 00:08:52.03
and it takes a moment, and it kicks in.

179
00:08:52.03 --> 00:08:54.05
Now, my lips are going
to be totally out of sync

180
00:08:54.05 --> 00:08:58.01
with my voice, because I chose
the higher quality method.

181
00:08:58.01 --> 00:09:01.08
That's because there's more of a delay.

182
00:09:01.08 --> 00:09:03.03
Now, that general process you

183
00:09:03.03 --> 00:09:06.01
just saw might have seemed
a little bit confusing,

184
00:09:06.01 --> 00:09:08.03
and you're going to
want to dig in and look

185
00:09:08.03 --> 00:09:11.09
at the documentation and
watch that video a few times.

186
00:09:11.09 --> 00:09:13.09
The secret is this.

187
00:09:13.09 --> 00:09:17.00
Use a tool like Open Broadcasting Studio

188
00:09:17.00 --> 00:09:20.02
and get your set up, whether
you're using built-in hardware

189
00:09:20.02 --> 00:09:21.09
or third-party hardware.

190
00:09:21.09 --> 00:09:25.05
Then, absolutely,
positively take advantage

191
00:09:25.05 --> 00:09:27.02
of the setup wizard.

192
00:09:27.02 --> 00:09:29.01
All you need is your streaming key,

193
00:09:29.01 --> 00:09:31.08
and YouTube will take care
of the rest in the background

194
00:09:31.08 --> 00:09:35.00
as it all becomes configured,
but what this means is

195
00:09:35.00 --> 00:09:37.00
that you can use multiple cameras

196
00:09:37.00 --> 00:09:40.06
or special hardware devices
and have even more control

197
00:09:40.06 --> 00:09:42.07
of what gets streamed live.

198
00:09:42.07 --> 00:09:44.06
Now, once the video's over, you'll see

199
00:09:44.06 --> 00:09:47.01
that it completes, and
then you can go over

200
00:09:47.01 --> 00:09:49.08
to your video manager to control this.

201
00:09:49.08 --> 00:09:52.09
It's now a video like any other video,

202
00:09:52.09 --> 00:09:56.05
and it will appear momentarily
in the video manager.

203
00:09:56.05 --> 00:09:59.04
Here's that live stream
we recorded a while ago.

204
00:09:59.04 --> 00:10:02.02
I'll go ahead and delete that one,

205
00:10:02.02 --> 00:10:04.07
and within a few minutes,
the video that we

206
00:10:04.07 --> 00:10:07.06
just recorded will appear in this list,

207
00:10:07.06 --> 00:10:09.09
and then we'll have the
ability to edit the controls,

208
00:10:09.09 --> 00:10:12.08
modify it, or do anything
else that's needed.

209
00:10:12.08 --> 00:10:15.08
It will take a moment for
YouTube to move the file over,

210
00:10:15.08 --> 00:10:18.01
but it will become a
video like anything else

211
00:10:18.01 --> 00:10:21.03
in the video manager, and
you can control the privacy

212
00:10:21.03 --> 00:10:24.00
and the information about the file.

213
00:10:24.00 --> 00:10:26.01
All right, hopefully that
gives you a pretty good idea

214
00:10:26.01 --> 00:10:27.08
on how live streaming works.

215
00:10:27.08 --> 00:10:30.03
I do invite you to check out
some of the other courses

216
00:10:30.03 --> 00:10:32.08
in the library about live video streaming

217
00:10:32.08 --> 00:10:35.07
and a class I have on webinars,
and you'll learn a lot more

218
00:10:35.07 --> 00:10:37.03
about putting this all together.
