1
00:00:00.04 --> 00:00:02.09
- Another service that
often interplays with your

2
00:00:02.09 --> 00:00:06.02
YouTube channel is going
to be a Google+ account.

3
00:00:06.02 --> 00:00:09.01
Google+ was established to
be a competitor to tools

4
00:00:09.01 --> 00:00:12.05
like Facebook, where people
can share social content,

5
00:00:12.05 --> 00:00:15.05
and brands could connect
with a bigger audience.

6
00:00:15.05 --> 00:00:17.02
Now, the platform has struggled a bit

7
00:00:17.02 --> 00:00:18.09
and has been downsized by Google,

8
00:00:18.09 --> 00:00:22.08
but it still often interacts
with YouTube in many ways.

9
00:00:22.08 --> 00:00:24.07
A couple things to keep in mind,

10
00:00:24.07 --> 00:00:28.00
with a Google+ account, this
used to be a requirement.

11
00:00:28.00 --> 00:00:31.03
Both YouTube and Google+ are
owned, of course, by Google.

12
00:00:31.03 --> 00:00:34.04
And originally, you had
to have a Google+ page

13
00:00:34.04 --> 00:00:37.02
for every YouTube
channel that you created.

14
00:00:37.02 --> 00:00:39.02
They've since gotten
rid of this requirement

15
00:00:39.02 --> 00:00:42.01
because Google+ just did not take off.

16
00:00:42.01 --> 00:00:45.02
Now, YouTube channels are
often connected to a Google+

17
00:00:45.02 --> 00:00:48.07
account, both because this
was a requirement in the past,

18
00:00:48.07 --> 00:00:52.01
and it does have certain
benefits for finding content.

19
00:00:52.01 --> 00:00:54.05
One of the advantages of Google+ is that

20
00:00:54.05 --> 00:00:57.02
it is a social network so you can reshare

21
00:00:57.02 --> 00:01:00.01
your YouTube videos to a Google+ page,

22
00:01:00.01 --> 00:01:02.04
and that content actually gets indexed,

23
00:01:02.04 --> 00:01:05.02
and it improves the chances
of being found because

24
00:01:05.02 --> 00:01:08.02
Google favors its search
results for both YouTube

25
00:01:08.02 --> 00:01:11.05
and Google+ when people
run a generic search.

26
00:01:11.05 --> 00:01:13.02
It will offer up opportunities

27
00:01:13.02 --> 00:01:15.05
for people to explore those sites.

28
00:01:15.05 --> 00:01:18.07
Remember, Google+ posts are
often featured higher in Google

29
00:01:18.07 --> 00:01:22.03
searches, which can lead to
improved discoverability.

30
00:01:22.03 --> 00:01:25.09
And another benefit is that the
Google+ pages are searchable

31
00:01:25.09 --> 00:01:29.00
so people who want to
explore a particular brand

32
00:01:29.00 --> 00:01:32.05
can go there and actually
take a look and find content.

33
00:01:32.05 --> 00:01:35.07
And while Google+ is not as
wildly popular as Facebook,

34
00:01:35.07 --> 00:01:39.06
it does still have a very
broad audience of users.

35
00:01:39.06 --> 00:01:42.06
Other things to keep in
mind, a Google+ profile

36
00:01:42.06 --> 00:01:45.09
is essentially managed by an individual,

37
00:01:45.09 --> 00:01:49.00
and it's accessible to only one account.

38
00:01:49.00 --> 00:01:51.09
So, if you create a Google ID,

39
00:01:51.09 --> 00:01:55.04
you have one Google+
profile that connects to it.

40
00:01:55.04 --> 00:01:58.01
One ID equals one profile.

41
00:01:58.01 --> 00:02:01.07
It's a one-to-one relationship,
and an ID and a profile

42
00:02:01.07 --> 00:02:06.00
page are supposed to be for a
single person, not a company.

43
00:02:06.00 --> 00:02:08.06
On the other hand, if you are working

44
00:02:08.06 --> 00:02:11.02
with a company, or a brand, or a product,

45
00:02:11.02 --> 00:02:14.03
you're going to create a Google+ page.

46
00:02:14.03 --> 00:02:17.00
This is just like a Facebook page as well.

47
00:02:17.00 --> 00:02:20.07
This is tied to a product,
a service, or a company,

48
00:02:20.07 --> 00:02:22.09
and, in fact, multiple Google IDs

49
00:02:22.09 --> 00:02:25.02
can have management over the page.

50
00:02:25.02 --> 00:02:28.04
What you're really seeing
here is that a Google+ page

51
00:02:28.04 --> 00:02:31.05
is very similar to a YouTube channel.

52
00:02:31.05 --> 00:02:36.03
One or more Google IDs tied
to individuals can control it,

53
00:02:36.03 --> 00:02:38.06
and it gives you a way to publish.

54
00:02:38.06 --> 00:02:41.01
Do keep in mind that
the Google+ requirement

55
00:02:41.01 --> 00:02:43.01
used to be in place for YouTube,

56
00:02:43.01 --> 00:02:46.00
so you will find a lot
of documentation articles

57
00:02:46.00 --> 00:02:49.09
that talk about the need and
the connection to Google+.

58
00:02:49.09 --> 00:02:52.02
This connection has been recently severed,

59
00:02:52.02 --> 00:02:54.02
but it is important to
note that there are still

60
00:02:54.02 --> 00:02:58.03
some benefits to using the Google+ page.

61
00:02:58.03 --> 00:03:04.04
So, for example, here is the
YouTube page for Photofocus,

62
00:03:04.04 --> 00:03:07.02
and here is the equivalent Google+ page,

63
00:03:07.02 --> 00:03:10.08
where people can find out
information and browse,

64
00:03:10.08 --> 00:03:13.00
as well as individuals who've contributed

65
00:03:13.00 --> 00:03:20.00
to Photofocus, and a community.

66
00:03:20.00 --> 00:03:24.02
The page features posts
and content from the blog,

67
00:03:24.02 --> 00:03:28.06
as well as any YouTube videos
that we've recently uploaded.

68
00:03:28.06 --> 00:03:32.00
The community is a separate
area that's been set up

69
00:03:32.00 --> 00:03:34.09
that people have to
request permission to join.

70
00:03:34.09 --> 00:03:38.00
And in this case, people are
sharing their photos and video

71
00:03:38.00 --> 00:03:42.03
and giving each other feedback
and coaching and information.

72
00:03:42.03 --> 00:03:45.09
So, this makes it easy for
people who read the website

73
00:03:45.09 --> 00:03:49.09
or view our YouTube channel
to interact with each other.

74
00:03:49.09 --> 00:03:52.05
This ecosystem is important.

75
00:03:52.05 --> 00:03:56.07
A Google+ community tied to
a Google+ page can be quite

76
00:03:56.07 --> 00:04:00.03
useful and a great way to
migrate some of the discussion

77
00:04:00.03 --> 00:04:03.05
off of YouTube to a little
bit more civil platform,

78
00:04:03.05 --> 00:04:06.09
where people can engage and
share content with each other.

79
00:04:06.09 --> 00:04:09.08
But, all in all, how you use Google+

80
00:04:09.08 --> 00:04:12.03
with your YouTube content is up to you.

81
00:04:12.03 --> 00:04:16.03
Some users use it a lot, some
users don't touch it at all,

82
00:04:16.03 --> 00:04:19.07
but be aware that Google+
and YouTube are connected,

83
00:04:19.07 --> 00:04:20.09
and there are certain benefits

84
00:04:20.09 --> 00:04:22.07
to using the two products together.
