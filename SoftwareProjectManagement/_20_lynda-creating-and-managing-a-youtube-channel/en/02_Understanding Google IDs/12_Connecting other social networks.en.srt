1
00:00:00.05 --> 00:00:02.09
- While being connected
on Google is a good idea,

2
00:00:02.09 --> 00:00:05.00
putting all of your brands together

3
00:00:05.00 --> 00:00:07.00
and organized and connecting multiple

4
00:00:07.00 --> 00:00:09.00
Google services together, there are,

5
00:00:09.00 --> 00:00:11.07
of course, other social networks.

6
00:00:11.07 --> 00:00:13.04
Now, YouTube itself supports a

7
00:00:13.04 --> 00:00:15.05
connection to Twitter, and in the past,

8
00:00:15.05 --> 00:00:18.00
they've supported platforms like Facebook.

9
00:00:18.00 --> 00:00:20.00
What this allows you to do is to tie

10
00:00:20.00 --> 00:00:22.03
the services together, so as you put a new

11
00:00:22.03 --> 00:00:24.01
piece of content up on YouTube,

12
00:00:24.01 --> 00:00:26.09
it triggers a tweet on Twitter.

13
00:00:26.09 --> 00:00:30.07
Now there are really two different
ways to connect accounts.

14
00:00:30.07 --> 00:00:33.00
One method is using the Connected

15
00:00:33.00 --> 00:00:35.05
Accounts section in your profile.

16
00:00:35.05 --> 00:00:38.07
This will currently allow
you to connect to Twitter.

17
00:00:38.07 --> 00:00:45.01
You do this under
YouTube.com/account_sharing.

18
00:00:45.01 --> 00:00:47.02
Additionally, you can control what

19
00:00:47.02 --> 00:00:50.09
is shared by adjusting
your privacy settings,

20
00:00:50.09 --> 00:00:53.05
and you can use other third-party tools

21
00:00:53.05 --> 00:00:56.02
if you want to share to other websites.

22
00:00:56.02 --> 00:00:58.09
Tools like Hootsuite
and dlvr.it can actually

23
00:00:58.09 --> 00:01:03.02
take a YouTube URL and
redistribute to other pages.

24
00:01:03.02 --> 00:01:05.03
Let's start with that first page.

25
00:01:05.03 --> 00:01:06.06
You'll see here, for example,

26
00:01:06.06 --> 00:01:08.05
that I can choose to connect it.

27
00:01:08.05 --> 00:01:10.05
Right now, it's connected to my personal

28
00:01:10.05 --> 00:01:14.04
Twitter page and not my
Photofocus Twitter page.

29
00:01:14.04 --> 00:01:18.04
I'll click the Edit button
and disconnect the account.

30
00:01:18.04 --> 00:01:22.00
Now, when I click Connect, it's
going to bring up a new dialog.

31
00:01:22.00 --> 00:01:28.03
Once I log in, I can choose
to authorize the application.

32
00:01:28.03 --> 00:01:32.03
And you'll see that it's now connected.

33
00:01:32.03 --> 00:01:34.03
I can tell it to automatically send up

34
00:01:34.03 --> 00:01:39.02
a tweet when a video is uploaded.

35
00:01:39.02 --> 00:01:43.03
Or, if a video is added
to a particular playlist.

36
00:01:43.03 --> 00:01:45.05
What happens is that any of these changes

37
00:01:45.05 --> 00:01:49.02
will only affect new videos going forward.

38
00:01:49.02 --> 00:01:53.06
If I check Upload a video,
and Add a video to playlist,

39
00:01:53.06 --> 00:01:55.03
it's not going to go through my library

40
00:01:55.03 --> 00:01:57.04
and suddenly send out hundreds of tweets

41
00:01:57.04 --> 00:01:59.08
for all of my existing content,

42
00:01:59.08 --> 00:02:04.02
rather, it will trigger only new content.

43
00:02:04.02 --> 00:02:06.05
Now, if you want to control what's done,

44
00:02:06.05 --> 00:02:10.09
you can also take a look
here at your Feed settings.

45
00:02:10.09 --> 00:02:13.04
This is where you can decide under Privacy

46
00:02:13.04 --> 00:02:16.09
of what sorts of things
you want to have happen.

47
00:02:16.09 --> 00:02:18.09
You can decide if you're going to share

48
00:02:18.09 --> 00:02:22.09
information in the feed for the activity.

49
00:02:22.09 --> 00:02:25.04
Make sure you visit
these privacy controls,

50
00:02:25.04 --> 00:02:27.08
so you know what's going to be shared.

51
00:02:27.08 --> 00:02:29.09
I generally decide to keep my views

52
00:02:29.09 --> 00:02:32.00
and my subscriptions private.

53
00:02:32.00 --> 00:02:33.08
I spent way too much time watching

54
00:02:33.08 --> 00:02:36.01
fan videos about Star
Wars, and I don't need

55
00:02:36.01 --> 00:02:38.01
to share that with the
Photofocus community

56
00:02:38.01 --> 00:02:40.02
who's interested in photography.

57
00:02:40.02 --> 00:02:41.09
What you want to make sure of is that

58
00:02:41.09 --> 00:02:43.07
your habits of viewing or perhaps

59
00:02:43.07 --> 00:02:46.09
if your 10-year-old daughter
gets ahold of your iPad,

60
00:02:46.09 --> 00:02:48.07
all the sudden you're not sharing

61
00:02:48.07 --> 00:02:51.07
toy unboxing videos with
your professional audience.

62
00:02:51.07 --> 00:02:54.02
So, make sure you turn on
these privacy settings,

63
00:02:54.02 --> 00:02:56.08
so you're in control of what gets shared.

64
00:02:56.08 --> 00:02:59.00
Additionally, you can
also have connections

65
00:02:59.00 --> 00:03:03.04
to other social networks
displayed on your profile.

66
00:03:03.04 --> 00:03:05.07
To do this, you'll click the Edit button

67
00:03:05.07 --> 00:03:09.00
in the top corner of the channel artwork.

68
00:03:09.00 --> 00:03:12.00
This will allow you to
add links on the page,

69
00:03:12.00 --> 00:03:13.09
and you can specify up to five

70
00:03:13.09 --> 00:03:16.02
links that will appear as icons.

71
00:03:16.02 --> 00:03:18.04
In fact, you can actually add more links,

72
00:03:18.04 --> 00:03:23.02
they just won't show as
icons on your navigation bar.

73
00:03:23.02 --> 00:03:24.07
You can also choose to add a

74
00:03:24.07 --> 00:03:27.08
Google Plus link as a sixth link.

75
00:03:27.08 --> 00:03:29.07
If you don't use all five slots,

76
00:03:29.07 --> 00:03:32.01
then the Google Plus link will still show,

77
00:03:32.01 --> 00:03:33.09
but you can have up to five other

78
00:03:33.09 --> 00:03:38.02
links and a Google Plus link.

79
00:03:38.02 --> 00:03:40.03
Remember, to edit this just click

80
00:03:40.03 --> 00:03:44.06
the top button and choose Edit links.

81
00:03:44.06 --> 00:03:49.05
Then those will be displayed
to folks as a series of icons.

82
00:03:49.05 --> 00:03:54.09
All right, let's take a
look at how this works.

83
00:03:54.09 --> 00:03:57.03
This will take you to a
page where you can actually

84
00:03:57.03 --> 00:04:01.09
edit information and decide
which links are shown.

85
00:04:01.09 --> 00:04:03.06
All right, let's take a look at this.

86
00:04:03.06 --> 00:04:07.02
I'll log in to YouTube and click

87
00:04:07.02 --> 00:04:10.03
my icon and choose My channel.

88
00:04:10.03 --> 00:04:16.07
Then I'll click Customize Channel.

89
00:04:16.07 --> 00:04:18.06
Now you'll see that you have the ability

90
00:04:18.06 --> 00:04:20.08
to update your artwork,
and we'll talk more

91
00:04:20.08 --> 00:04:23.08
about this artwork in a later chapter.

92
00:04:23.08 --> 00:04:25.04
If you click on the Edit button

93
00:04:25.04 --> 00:04:31.06
here, you can edit the links.

94
00:04:31.06 --> 00:04:34.02
If you scroll down below your description,

95
00:04:34.02 --> 00:04:38.03
you'll see the links that are present.

96
00:04:38.03 --> 00:04:43.09
If you want to customize
these, click Customize Channel.

97
00:04:43.09 --> 00:04:47.07
Now, you'll see all of the controls.

98
00:04:47.07 --> 00:04:51.02
You can decide to
display up to five links.

99
00:04:51.02 --> 00:04:54.02
However, you can add additional links,

100
00:04:54.02 --> 00:04:58.00
and these'll be shown below your bio.

101
00:04:58.00 --> 00:05:00.01
Add the key information you want

102
00:05:00.01 --> 00:05:03.05
along with the individual links here.

103
00:05:03.05 --> 00:05:05.02
For example, I don't need to show the

104
00:05:05.02 --> 00:05:07.03
YouTube page on YouTube,
but I might want to

105
00:05:07.03 --> 00:05:12.02
point people to my iTunes
podcast and my SoundCloud page.

106
00:05:12.02 --> 00:05:14.07
Maybe we want to connect
on Twitter and Facebook.

107
00:05:14.07 --> 00:05:16.08
Well, I can do that.

108
00:05:16.08 --> 00:05:18.09
The Google Plus link is going to be

109
00:05:18.09 --> 00:05:22.09
automatically filled
in, and you can decide

110
00:05:22.09 --> 00:05:26.05
whether or not you want that
to be displayed to people.

111
00:05:26.05 --> 00:05:28.01
If you have a Google Plus page

112
00:05:28.01 --> 00:05:31.08
but don't maintain it, uncheck that box.

113
00:05:31.08 --> 00:05:37.02
If you want to remove a link,
just click the trashcan.

114
00:05:37.02 --> 00:05:39.04
Now if you decide to reorder links,

115
00:05:39.04 --> 00:05:41.01
there is no way to do that other than

116
00:05:41.01 --> 00:05:43.08
copying and pasting the information.

117
00:05:43.08 --> 00:05:46.04
Simply add a new field and start copying

118
00:05:46.04 --> 00:05:49.09
and pasting to move the content around.

119
00:05:49.09 --> 00:05:54.01
Let's go back a level here.

120
00:05:54.01 --> 00:05:57.07
You'll see that those
appear over here overlaid.

121
00:05:57.07 --> 00:06:01.09
This makes it easy to see
that content and to connect.

122
00:06:01.09 --> 00:06:03.09
In fact, it'll often try to pull

123
00:06:03.09 --> 00:06:05.06
a relevant piece of artwork.

124
00:06:05.06 --> 00:06:08.01
Let's make that a little
bit bigger so you can see.

125
00:06:08.01 --> 00:06:11.00
You'll notice that it pulled
different types of artwork

126
00:06:11.00 --> 00:06:14.08
for the different areas,
Google Plus, Facebook.

127
00:06:14.08 --> 00:06:17.08
Now certain content here,
it's not going to necessarily

128
00:06:17.08 --> 00:06:21.05
know what icons to
show, so it will depend.

129
00:06:21.05 --> 00:06:24.08
This same view is available
on a mobile device as well.

130
00:06:24.08 --> 00:06:27.06
If the user connects with a page,

131
00:06:27.06 --> 00:06:29.03
you'll notice a few things.

132
00:06:29.03 --> 00:06:32.04
First up, the artwork
buttons weren't overlaid

133
00:06:32.04 --> 00:06:35.09
on mobile, but if they
go to the About page,

134
00:06:35.09 --> 00:06:39.06
you'll see that those
links were available.

135
00:06:39.06 --> 00:06:42.06
Now the user can choose to jump over.

136
00:06:42.06 --> 00:06:45.03
If I want them to go right to my website,

137
00:06:45.03 --> 00:06:49.04
with one click, they will
leave the YouTube app

138
00:06:49.04 --> 00:06:52.02
and switch over to Photofocus.com.

139
00:06:52.02 --> 00:06:56.06
When the viewer is done and
they click the Done button,

140
00:06:56.06 --> 00:06:59.06
they are returned right
to the YouTube page.

141
00:06:59.06 --> 00:07:02.01
So, this does work quite nicely.

142
00:07:02.01 --> 00:07:05.02
I would like to see that those
same buttons become overlays

143
00:07:05.02 --> 00:07:09.00
here, but different devices
will show this differently.

144
00:07:09.00 --> 00:07:10.08
YouTube continuously improves its

145
00:07:10.08 --> 00:07:13.06
mobile apps for iOS and Android.

146
00:07:13.06 --> 00:07:15.06
Taking the time to customize these links

147
00:07:15.06 --> 00:07:17.02
and build them in will improve

148
00:07:17.02 --> 00:07:19.08
discoverability for your content.

149
00:07:19.08 --> 00:07:21.02
One of the things I'm
going to let you know

150
00:07:21.02 --> 00:07:22.09
is that you want to get people off

151
00:07:22.09 --> 00:07:25.06
of YouTube and onto your website.

152
00:07:25.06 --> 00:07:27.03
In fact, YouTube is designed from

153
00:07:27.03 --> 00:07:30.00
the ground up to pull people into it.

154
00:07:30.00 --> 00:07:32.00
When a YouTube video finishes playing,

155
00:07:32.00 --> 00:07:34.01
even on your website, by default,

156
00:07:34.01 --> 00:07:37.00
it shows other videos that
the viewer might like,

157
00:07:37.00 --> 00:07:38.08
usually having nothing to do with your

158
00:07:38.08 --> 00:07:41.04
content, maybe even from a competitor,

159
00:07:41.04 --> 00:07:44.02
and it pulls them back to YouTube.com.

160
00:07:44.02 --> 00:07:48.04
They click the YouTube icon,
it's pulls them to YouTube.com.

161
00:07:48.04 --> 00:07:51.03
This is fair play, this is ability for you

162
00:07:51.03 --> 00:07:55.02
to pull people off of
YouTube back to your website

163
00:07:55.02 --> 00:07:57.04
where it's much easier to engage them,

164
00:07:57.04 --> 00:08:00.03
keep them as a customer, and
potentially monetize them.
