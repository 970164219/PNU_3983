1
00:00:00.05 --> 00:00:02.01
- Now, we've talked about the concept

2
00:00:02.01 --> 00:00:05.05
of a Brand Account with
multiple managers before,

3
00:00:05.05 --> 00:00:07.01
but I'd like to go a
little bit more deeply

4
00:00:07.01 --> 00:00:08.05
on how you can work together

5
00:00:08.05 --> 00:00:10.03
with multiple people as a team

6
00:00:10.03 --> 00:00:12.06
to manage a YouTube channel.

7
00:00:12.06 --> 00:00:18.00
So first you'll sign in as the
owner of the Brand Account.

8
00:00:18.00 --> 00:00:19.09
Then, in the upper right hand corner,

9
00:00:19.09 --> 00:00:21.06
you'll click the account icon,

10
00:00:21.06 --> 00:00:23.04
which drops down a menu,

11
00:00:23.04 --> 00:00:25.04
and you'll need to select the channel

12
00:00:25.04 --> 00:00:27.08
that you want to manage.

13
00:00:27.08 --> 00:00:31.00
From here you can click the settings icon,

14
00:00:31.00 --> 00:00:33.01
and you'll see the ability to add

15
00:00:33.01 --> 00:00:35.07
or remove managers.

16
00:00:35.07 --> 00:00:38.06
Then you'll simply be switched over

17
00:00:38.06 --> 00:00:40.09
to the Brand Account details page

18
00:00:40.09 --> 00:00:43.06
where it's very simple to add people.

19
00:00:43.06 --> 00:00:47.06
Then you'll need to
click manage permissions.

20
00:00:47.06 --> 00:00:50.03
You'll be presented with a few choices.

21
00:00:50.03 --> 00:00:51.09
You can add an owner,

22
00:00:51.09 --> 00:00:53.04
and this is someone who will have

23
00:00:53.04 --> 00:00:56.01
the ability to actually own the page

24
00:00:56.01 --> 00:00:58.01
and decide what happens to it.

25
00:00:58.01 --> 00:01:00.03
A page can only have one owner,

26
00:01:00.03 --> 00:01:03.01
so this could be useful
if you've sold the website

27
00:01:03.01 --> 00:01:05.09
or had to setup a YouTube
channel for someone else

28
00:01:05.09 --> 00:01:08.05
and then transfer the
ownership over to them

29
00:01:08.05 --> 00:01:10.08
for their turn to manage it.

30
00:01:10.08 --> 00:01:12.06
You can also add managers.

31
00:01:12.06 --> 00:01:14.02
To do this you'll need to enter

32
00:01:14.02 --> 00:01:16.00
a valid email address.

33
00:01:16.00 --> 00:01:19.08
You don't have to know their Google ID.

34
00:01:19.08 --> 00:01:22.06
You then click invite,
and once they accept it,

35
00:01:22.06 --> 00:01:26.03
they'll be connected to the channel.

36
00:01:26.03 --> 00:01:28.05
You can also do this to promote someone

37
00:01:28.05 --> 00:01:33.03
from an owner down to a
manager or vice versa.

38
00:01:33.03 --> 00:01:34.06
Here's how that works.

39
00:01:34.06 --> 00:01:37.02
To start, make sure you're logged in

40
00:01:37.02 --> 00:01:39.09
and then click on the icon here,

41
00:01:39.09 --> 00:01:41.09
and make sure that
you're using the account

42
00:01:41.09 --> 00:01:43.02
you want to manage.

43
00:01:43.02 --> 00:01:45.04
If you don't have the
current one selected,

44
00:01:45.04 --> 00:01:48.01
you can click switch account

45
00:01:48.01 --> 00:01:50.00
and see all of the different choices

46
00:01:50.00 --> 00:01:52.09
for the pages that you manage.

47
00:01:52.09 --> 00:01:56.02
Then click the settings icon.

48
00:01:56.02 --> 00:01:58.05
On this page you can choose to add

49
00:01:58.05 --> 00:02:04.02
or remove managers.

50
00:02:04.02 --> 00:02:07.08
Click the manage permissions button,

51
00:02:07.08 --> 00:02:11.04
and you will see who has access.

52
00:02:11.04 --> 00:02:14.04
For example, we have multiple managers

53
00:02:14.04 --> 00:02:16.01
and someone who's been invited

54
00:02:16.01 --> 00:02:18.01
but hasn't yet accepted.

55
00:02:18.01 --> 00:02:19.07
If I want to remove someone,

56
00:02:19.07 --> 00:02:23.00
I just click the X button
and they are removed

57
00:02:23.00 --> 00:02:26.00
and no longer have privileges.

58
00:02:26.00 --> 00:02:27.05
If I want to add someone,

59
00:02:27.05 --> 00:02:29.08
I simply click the plus button here

60
00:02:29.08 --> 00:02:33.01
and enter their name.

61
00:02:33.01 --> 00:02:34.04
Or, if I'm not sure

62
00:02:34.04 --> 00:02:36.05
that this is their particular Google ID,

63
00:02:36.05 --> 00:02:45.03
I can enter an email address.

64
00:02:45.03 --> 00:02:47.08
From the choose a role you can decide

65
00:02:47.08 --> 00:02:50.02
what they're allowed to do.

66
00:02:50.02 --> 00:02:55.04
You can only have one owner on the page.

67
00:02:55.04 --> 00:02:58.01
Additionally, managers have the ability

68
00:02:58.01 --> 00:03:01.05
to actually make changes
to the page itself

69
00:03:01.05 --> 00:03:03.06
like playlist and upload.

70
00:03:03.06 --> 00:03:05.00
Or, if you just want someone

71
00:03:05.00 --> 00:03:06.09
to be able to send out messages

72
00:03:06.09 --> 00:03:12.00
or reply to comments, make
them a communications manager.

73
00:03:12.00 --> 00:03:14.08
Once they are invited,
they'll be added to the list

74
00:03:14.08 --> 00:03:19.07
as a pending member, and you'll
see their potential role.

75
00:03:19.07 --> 00:03:22.02
When done just click the done button,

76
00:03:22.02 --> 00:03:24.00
and it will update.

77
00:03:24.00 --> 00:03:26.00
This ability to collaborate with others

78
00:03:26.00 --> 00:03:27.08
and invite them to your page

79
00:03:27.08 --> 00:03:31.07
makes it very easy for them
to actually be a contributor.

80
00:03:31.07 --> 00:03:33.02
For example, if you've invited someone

81
00:03:33.02 --> 00:03:34.06
to be a manager, and they're going to use

82
00:03:34.06 --> 00:03:37.03
their mobile device, well,
they can now live stream

83
00:03:37.03 --> 00:03:38.09
directly to the page, which means

84
00:03:38.09 --> 00:03:40.06
that maybe they're at a trade show

85
00:03:40.06 --> 00:03:43.01
and they want to do an on
the show floor interview,

86
00:03:43.01 --> 00:03:45.03
or maybe they need to do a live event.

87
00:03:45.03 --> 00:03:47.01
Well, if you've added them as a manager,

88
00:03:47.01 --> 00:03:48.03
they can do that.

89
00:03:48.03 --> 00:03:49.09
So this is a very useful way

90
00:03:49.09 --> 00:03:52.09
to give people access
to a particular channel

91
00:03:52.09 --> 00:03:55.06
without actually worrying
about giving them the keys

92
00:03:55.06 --> 00:03:56.04
to the castle.
