1
00:00:00.05 --> 00:00:03.00
- You might have noticed on
some of my log-in screens

2
00:00:03.00 --> 00:00:06.01
that I have access to
multiple YouTube channels.

3
00:00:06.01 --> 00:00:08.06
That's because I create
content for YouTube for a

4
00:00:08.06 --> 00:00:10.09
handful of different software companies.

5
00:00:10.09 --> 00:00:13.00
And I also have some personal pages

6
00:00:13.00 --> 00:00:14.08
and some professional pages

7
00:00:14.08 --> 00:00:17.02
that I maintain or contribute to.

8
00:00:17.02 --> 00:00:21.07
As such, it's easy to access
multiple brand accounts.

9
00:00:21.07 --> 00:00:24.03
Now, do keep in mind
that generally speaking,

10
00:00:24.03 --> 00:00:27.04
you're only going to
have one Google account.

11
00:00:27.04 --> 00:00:30.00
You might have a few Google
IDs that you've set up

12
00:00:30.00 --> 00:00:31.05
for very specific purposes,

13
00:00:31.05 --> 00:00:34.08
particularly if you've set-up
separate Gmail accounts

14
00:00:34.08 --> 00:00:37.04
in order to manage your email inbox.

15
00:00:37.04 --> 00:00:38.06
Each of those Google IDs

16
00:00:38.06 --> 00:00:41.01
might end up having their own account.

17
00:00:41.01 --> 00:00:44.07
But not every Google ID is
going to be connected to a brand

18
00:00:44.07 --> 00:00:47.01
or a YouTube channel.

19
00:00:47.01 --> 00:00:49.03
Also, remember that you can have

20
00:00:49.03 --> 00:00:51.02
multiple connected Brand Accounts.

21
00:00:51.02 --> 00:00:55.06
In fact, you can have almost
a hundred of these if needed.

22
00:00:55.06 --> 00:00:58.01
In order to access these, you simply click

23
00:00:58.01 --> 00:01:01.04
on your account profile to switch.

24
00:01:01.04 --> 00:01:02.07
You may need to make sure that

25
00:01:02.07 --> 00:01:04.09
you've successfully
connected to a brand account

26
00:01:04.09 --> 00:01:06.09
if you don't see it in the switcher.

27
00:01:06.09 --> 00:01:09.03
You'll notice the Google ID,

28
00:01:09.03 --> 00:01:12.03
and below it, the brands.

29
00:01:12.03 --> 00:01:16.02
You might switch to another Google ID.

30
00:01:16.02 --> 00:01:21.07
For example, that new account I set up.

31
00:01:21.07 --> 00:01:24.03
And you see that it has one brand account

32
00:01:24.03 --> 00:01:26.08
associated with this YouTube Channel.

33
00:01:26.08 --> 00:01:29.08
If I go to switch accounts though,

34
00:01:29.08 --> 00:01:31.08
you'll see that the others are available

35
00:01:31.08 --> 00:01:34.02
in the More Accounts section.

36
00:01:34.02 --> 00:01:38.02
So you can be logged in with
more than one Google ID.

37
00:01:38.02 --> 00:01:41.06
You do that down here with
the Add Account button,

38
00:01:41.06 --> 00:01:44.02
which prompts you to
sign in with a different

39
00:01:44.02 --> 00:01:46.09
Google Account that you
might have access to.

40
00:01:46.09 --> 00:01:48.07
In this case, I have multiple ones

41
00:01:48.07 --> 00:01:50.02
for other members of my family

42
00:01:50.02 --> 00:01:52.03
and children that we maintain.

43
00:01:52.03 --> 00:01:54.09
To control Brand Accounts, simply visit

44
00:01:54.09 --> 00:01:59.07
youtube.com/account_advanced

45
00:01:59.07 --> 00:02:01.07
Under the account information area,

46
00:02:01.07 --> 00:02:03.07
you can look for some of the following:

47
00:02:03.07 --> 00:02:04.08
If you see the message,

48
00:02:04.08 --> 00:02:06.07
"You are the owner of this channel

49
00:02:06.07 --> 00:02:09.01
and the connected Brand
Account," this means

50
00:02:09.01 --> 00:02:11.00
that you've already
set up a brand account.

51
00:02:11.00 --> 00:02:12.02
Which usually happens when

52
00:02:12.02 --> 00:02:15.06
you first create a YouTube channel.

53
00:02:15.06 --> 00:02:16.06
If you don't see a note,

54
00:02:16.06 --> 00:02:19.06
then you're going to need to
create a new Brand Account

55
00:02:19.06 --> 00:02:24.01
or associate your channel with
an existing Brand Account.

56
00:02:24.01 --> 00:02:25.03
Let's visit that page.

57
00:02:25.03 --> 00:02:27.00
You'll see for example, it tells me that

58
00:02:27.00 --> 00:02:28.05
I'm the owner of the channel,

59
00:02:28.05 --> 00:02:30.09
and the connected brand account.

60
00:02:30.09 --> 00:02:34.04
It tells me that I'm
signed in as a YouTube user

61
00:02:34.04 --> 00:02:38.00
with a user ID and a channel ID.

62
00:02:38.00 --> 00:02:39.06
If I click the link here,

63
00:02:39.06 --> 00:02:42.04
I can actually move things around.

64
00:02:42.04 --> 00:02:45.04
Now, you may be prompted to
log back in to your account

65
00:02:45.04 --> 00:02:48.00
and validate your password.

66
00:02:48.00 --> 00:02:50.09
But this allows you to move a channel.

67
00:02:50.09 --> 00:02:54.09
So, for example, right now
my YouTube user channel

68
00:02:54.09 --> 00:02:58.00
is connected to the
Photofocus brand account.

69
00:02:58.00 --> 00:03:01.02
But if I wanted to move
that to a different channel,

70
00:03:01.02 --> 00:03:06.00
I can do that and connect
it to a new Brand Account.

71
00:03:06.00 --> 00:03:08.08
Or in some cases here,
you'll see other accounts

72
00:03:08.08 --> 00:03:11.01
that already have YouTube channels.

73
00:03:11.01 --> 00:03:14.01
So if I click this here,
it's going to get rid of

74
00:03:14.01 --> 00:03:19.00
and permanently delete an
existing channel and replace it.

75
00:03:19.00 --> 00:03:22.06
As such, absolutely
positively do not click

76
00:03:22.06 --> 00:03:23.08
the delete channel button

77
00:03:23.08 --> 00:03:27.01
unless you want to lose
all of those videos.

78
00:03:27.01 --> 00:03:29.01
So I'll click cancel here.

79
00:03:29.01 --> 00:03:30.09
Be extremely cautious when

80
00:03:30.09 --> 00:03:34.02
moving a YouTube channel to
a different Brand Account.

81
00:03:34.02 --> 00:03:39.00
Each Brand Account can only
have one channel on YouTube.

82
00:03:39.00 --> 00:03:41.04
So as such, you might want to move

83
00:03:41.04 --> 00:03:43.02
to a new Brand Account that

84
00:03:43.02 --> 00:03:45.05
doesn't yet have a YouTube channel,

85
00:03:45.05 --> 00:03:47.06
or be absolutely certain that if

86
00:03:47.06 --> 00:03:50.03
you're connecting it to
an existing Brand Account,

87
00:03:50.03 --> 00:03:51.09
that you'll want to blow away

88
00:03:51.09 --> 00:03:53.04
another YouTube channel

89
00:03:53.04 --> 00:03:56.00
and replace it with the one you're moving.

90
00:03:56.00 --> 00:03:58.03
Remember the Google Brand Account

91
00:03:58.03 --> 00:04:00.04
is used across multiple services,

92
00:04:00.04 --> 00:04:02.08
including Google+, Google My Business,

93
00:04:02.08 --> 00:04:06.01
Google Photos, and YouTube.

94
00:04:06.01 --> 00:04:09.09
This is different than the
Google ID that you use to sign in

95
00:04:09.09 --> 00:04:12.04
to other services, such as Google Docs,

96
00:04:12.04 --> 00:04:15.04
and Sheets, and others.

97
00:04:15.04 --> 00:04:17.04
And remember, if you've already

98
00:04:17.04 --> 00:04:19.01
created a channel on YouTube,

99
00:04:19.01 --> 00:04:22.07
it should already be
connected to a Brand Account.

100
00:04:22.07 --> 00:04:24.05
But what may often happen,

101
00:04:24.05 --> 00:04:25.08
is that you'll find yourself

102
00:04:25.08 --> 00:04:28.02
needing to create a new Brand Account.

103
00:04:28.02 --> 00:04:30.08
Maybe a company rolls out another product,

104
00:04:30.08 --> 00:04:34.06
and as such, you might want
to move a YouTube channel

105
00:04:34.06 --> 00:04:37.06
to another Brand Account
to free up a slot.

106
00:04:37.06 --> 00:04:41.02
Remember, one YouTube
channel to one Brand Account,

107
00:04:41.02 --> 00:04:43.08
but many Brand Accounts can be shared

108
00:04:43.08 --> 00:04:46.01
by one or more Google ID.
