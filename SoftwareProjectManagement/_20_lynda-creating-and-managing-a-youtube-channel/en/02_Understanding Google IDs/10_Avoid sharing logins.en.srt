1
00:00:00.05 --> 00:00:03.01
- We've talked pretty
extensively about the concept

2
00:00:03.01 --> 00:00:05.00
of having different people connected

3
00:00:05.00 --> 00:00:07.02
to a channel or a brand account.

4
00:00:07.02 --> 00:00:08.09
And that's very important,

5
00:00:08.09 --> 00:00:10.07
but I'd like to take a moment to reiterate

6
00:00:10.07 --> 00:00:14.04
the dangers of handing
out your YouTube login.

7
00:00:14.04 --> 00:00:17.01
Under no circumstances
should you be sharing

8
00:00:17.01 --> 00:00:20.04
your personal Google ID
or passwords with people,

9
00:00:20.04 --> 00:00:22.05
there's no need to.

10
00:00:22.05 --> 00:00:25.01
Do not give out your personal Google ID

11
00:00:25.01 --> 00:00:27.06
and login information to anyone else

12
00:00:27.06 --> 00:00:31.07
because it ties to a substantial
amount of personal data

13
00:00:31.07 --> 00:00:35.03
and potential financial information.

14
00:00:35.03 --> 00:00:37.01
There is a major security risk here

15
00:00:37.01 --> 00:00:39.00
by allowing people to have access to

16
00:00:39.00 --> 00:00:41.02
so much information about you,

17
00:00:41.02 --> 00:00:43.05
where you've lived, where you've worked,

18
00:00:43.05 --> 00:00:46.05
what phone numbers you have.

19
00:00:46.05 --> 00:00:49.01
Instead, add those individuals

20
00:00:49.01 --> 00:00:52.04
as account managers or
communications managers,

21
00:00:52.04 --> 00:00:55.06
this will allow them to
publish to YouTube as needed,

22
00:00:55.06 --> 00:00:58.00
without having to worry about this.

23
00:00:58.00 --> 00:01:01.00
Additionally, if you add
them at the brand level,

24
00:01:01.00 --> 00:01:03.06
they can actually do other
things on other properties,

25
00:01:03.06 --> 00:01:07.08
like your Google+ pages.

26
00:01:07.08 --> 00:01:10.02
The account owner can ultimately

27
00:01:10.02 --> 00:01:12.07
revoke managers as needed,

28
00:01:12.07 --> 00:01:14.08
so if someone leaves the company

29
00:01:14.08 --> 00:01:17.05
or starts to act
inappropriately on your behalf

30
00:01:17.05 --> 00:01:21.03
posting content to your YouTube
channel that you don't want,

31
00:01:21.03 --> 00:01:24.04
you can actually remove
their access to the page

32
00:01:24.04 --> 00:01:27.04
without having to change
a username or password,

33
00:01:27.04 --> 00:01:31.08
you simple revoke their access.

34
00:01:31.08 --> 00:01:34.05
Remember, if needed account ownership

35
00:01:34.05 --> 00:01:37.00
can be transferred to another manager,

36
00:01:37.00 --> 00:01:40.05
this can come in handy if
you actually sell a property,

37
00:01:40.05 --> 00:01:42.07
or perhaps, you work for the IT department

38
00:01:42.07 --> 00:01:43.08
or the marketing department,

39
00:01:43.08 --> 00:01:46.02
and you've built out the YouTube channel,

40
00:01:46.02 --> 00:01:48.07
once it's established and properly set up,

41
00:01:48.07 --> 00:01:49.08
maybe you're going to hand it off

42
00:01:49.08 --> 00:01:51.09
to a different department to run.

43
00:01:51.09 --> 00:01:54.05
Well in any case, the
ability to transfer ownership

44
00:01:54.05 --> 00:01:57.00
is very important, and this is in place

45
00:01:57.00 --> 00:02:00.00
both for contractors and employees.

46
00:02:00.00 --> 00:02:02.06
It's very important that the account owner

47
00:02:02.06 --> 00:02:04.03
isn't going anywhere.

48
00:02:04.03 --> 00:02:06.03
Now if you are the account owner,

49
00:02:06.03 --> 00:02:08.09
and there's a lot of
things tied together here,

50
00:02:08.09 --> 00:02:12.06
you may want to make one
careful consideration,

51
00:02:12.06 --> 00:02:15.07
if you are the account owner
there is a certain value

52
00:02:15.07 --> 00:02:18.00
to having the username and password

53
00:02:18.00 --> 00:02:20.01
written down and secured somewhere

54
00:02:20.01 --> 00:02:23.07
that if you are incapacitated
due to health reasons

55
00:02:23.07 --> 00:02:25.07
and someone else within your organization

56
00:02:25.07 --> 00:02:27.07
needs to take over an ownership role,

57
00:02:27.07 --> 00:02:30.04
you have a mechanism in place to do that.

58
00:02:30.04 --> 00:02:33.02
But be extremely careful
with that information

59
00:02:33.02 --> 00:02:35.05
because it ties to a plethora

60
00:02:35.05 --> 00:02:38.07
of personal data that you
don't want casually shared.
