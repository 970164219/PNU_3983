1
00:00:01.00 --> 00:00:03.03
- Earlier, we talked about brand accounts

2
00:00:03.03 --> 00:00:05.09
but something comes
before the brand account

3
00:00:05.09 --> 00:00:08.00
and that's the Google ID.

4
00:00:08.00 --> 00:00:09.08
This is the individual ID

5
00:00:09.08 --> 00:00:12.09
that's associated with you, the person,

6
00:00:12.09 --> 00:00:15.03
and most commonly, this is first created

7
00:00:15.03 --> 00:00:17.08
when someone sets up a Gmail account.

8
00:00:17.08 --> 00:00:19.05
Now, these are the types of IDs

9
00:00:19.05 --> 00:00:21.07
that move across all Google services

10
00:00:21.07 --> 00:00:23.06
and you can use them for logging in

11
00:00:23.06 --> 00:00:25.05
on your tablet or mobile phones,

12
00:00:25.05 --> 00:00:29.02
for remote payments or
accessing other Google services

13
00:00:29.02 --> 00:00:32.01
or perhaps you use it when
you log into your email.

14
00:00:32.01 --> 00:00:34.04
But, chances are, you have an ID

15
00:00:34.04 --> 00:00:36.00
that ties back to you

16
00:00:36.00 --> 00:00:37.08
and you probably established it

17
00:00:37.08 --> 00:00:39.06
with a phone number that you verified

18
00:00:39.06 --> 00:00:42.07
and the ability to provide
an additional email

19
00:00:42.07 --> 00:00:46.02
that Google can use to contact
you if there's a problem.

20
00:00:46.02 --> 00:00:48.06
Well, let's explore how this
all ties back into YouTube.

21
00:00:48.06 --> 00:00:52.06
With your Google ID, it's
going to serve many purposes.

22
00:00:52.06 --> 00:00:54.08
Essentially, it's an account
that you're going to use

23
00:00:54.08 --> 00:00:57.01
for access and authentication

24
00:00:57.01 --> 00:00:59.08
to many different Google properties.

25
00:00:59.08 --> 00:01:02.04
So, if you're using Gmail or Google+

26
00:01:02.04 --> 00:01:04.06
to email folks or connect socially,

27
00:01:04.06 --> 00:01:06.05
you're going to use a Google ID.

28
00:01:06.05 --> 00:01:08.02
When you participate in Google Hangouts

29
00:01:08.02 --> 00:01:10.09
for online meetings or
you upload to YouTube

30
00:01:10.09 --> 00:01:13.07
or you go to edit a map on Google,

31
00:01:13.07 --> 00:01:16.05
well, you're going to need a Google ID.

32
00:01:16.05 --> 00:01:18.01
Now, keep in mind that when people go

33
00:01:18.01 --> 00:01:19.06
to access Google properties,

34
00:01:19.06 --> 00:01:21.09
they might not need a Google ID.

35
00:01:21.09 --> 00:01:24.05
For example, if you're just going
to watch content on YouTube,

36
00:01:24.05 --> 00:01:25.04
no big deal.

37
00:01:25.04 --> 00:01:27.07
You can watch as much
as you want, in general

38
00:01:27.07 --> 00:01:30.05
and if you're going to go
ahead and browse Google Maps,

39
00:01:30.05 --> 00:01:32.03
you don't need a Google ID.

40
00:01:32.03 --> 00:01:34.08
But if you want to edit that
Google Map and make a change,

41
00:01:34.08 --> 00:01:36.03
you need a Google ID.

42
00:01:36.03 --> 00:01:39.08
If you want to upload to
YouTube, you need a Google ID.

43
00:01:39.08 --> 00:01:41.09
If you want to watch content on YouTube

44
00:01:41.09 --> 00:01:45.01
that's been rated for adults 18 and over,

45
00:01:45.01 --> 00:01:47.02
well, you need a Google ID.

46
00:01:47.02 --> 00:01:49.07
So, in the case of my 14-year-old son,

47
00:01:49.07 --> 00:01:51.04
he can watch YouTube all he wants

48
00:01:51.04 --> 00:01:53.05
but when he tries to watch a video

49
00:01:53.05 --> 00:01:57.02
that's not appropriate for
a child in high school,

50
00:01:57.02 --> 00:01:59.01
well, it's going to flag it and require

51
00:01:59.01 --> 00:02:01.04
that he logs in with a Google ID

52
00:02:01.04 --> 00:02:04.06
which knows his age because
we, as his parents, set it up.

53
00:02:04.06 --> 00:02:06.04
So he's unable to watch that content

54
00:02:06.04 --> 00:02:08.05
that's been flagged as only

55
00:02:08.05 --> 00:02:11.01
for those adults over the age of 18.

56
00:02:11.01 --> 00:02:12.08
Now, there are all sorts of other things

57
00:02:12.08 --> 00:02:15.03
about Google's community
standards and other things

58
00:02:15.03 --> 00:02:18.07
but do keep in mind that YouTube
does try to protect youth

59
00:02:18.07 --> 00:02:21.06
by making certain videos hard to find

60
00:02:21.06 --> 00:02:23.05
or making it more difficult.

61
00:02:23.05 --> 00:02:25.08
However, of course, this
doesn't counteract for the fact

62
00:02:25.08 --> 00:02:27.04
that people have to self select

63
00:02:27.04 --> 00:02:30.02
that their videos are supposed
to be for this audience

64
00:02:30.02 --> 00:02:32.03
unless enough complaints come in.

65
00:02:32.03 --> 00:02:36.04
So as you get it, the Google
ID is you, the individual.

66
00:02:36.04 --> 00:02:37.08
So if you're going to
have a YouTube channel,

67
00:02:37.08 --> 00:02:39.07
you need a Google ID.

68
00:02:39.07 --> 00:02:41.05
If you're going to be
uploading to YouTube,

69
00:02:41.05 --> 00:02:44.09
to your channel or someone
else's, you need a Google ID.

70
00:02:44.09 --> 00:02:46.09
Now, I probably have upwards of 20

71
00:02:46.09 --> 00:02:47.07
of these through the years

72
00:02:47.07 --> 00:02:49.06
of all of the different
Gmail accounts we've had

73
00:02:49.06 --> 00:02:50.08
to set up for things,

74
00:02:50.08 --> 00:02:53.07
but through the use of Google
ID's and brand accounts,

75
00:02:53.07 --> 00:02:56.07
you can actually narrow down
how many Google ID's you have.

76
00:02:56.07 --> 00:03:00.03
One Google ID can be connected
to many brand accounts

77
00:03:00.03 --> 00:03:02.08
and this will make it a lot
easier for you to manage

78
00:03:02.08 --> 00:03:05.05
without constantly having
to log in and out of apps.

79
00:03:05.05 --> 00:03:08.04
Other things to keep in
mind is that the Google ID

80
00:03:08.04 --> 00:03:11.03
can provide a publicly accessible profile.

81
00:03:11.03 --> 00:03:13.00
This allows other Google users

82
00:03:13.00 --> 00:03:15.04
to learn about you or your business.

83
00:03:15.04 --> 00:03:16.07
Now, generally speaking,

84
00:03:16.07 --> 00:03:18.09
this is going to be you as an individual

85
00:03:18.09 --> 00:03:21.02
so it can include things
about your website,

86
00:03:21.02 --> 00:03:22.08
for your personal website,

87
00:03:22.08 --> 00:03:25.03
contact information that
you choose to share,

88
00:03:25.03 --> 00:03:27.06
some of your favorite photos, et cetera.

89
00:03:27.06 --> 00:03:30.08
But the business or brand can
have it's own profile page

90
00:03:30.08 --> 00:03:32.05
and that's generally different.

91
00:03:32.05 --> 00:03:34.04
A Google profile can also be linked

92
00:03:34.04 --> 00:03:37.03
to other profiles on other
social networking sites.

93
00:03:37.03 --> 00:03:39.03
So Google allows you to connect to things

94
00:03:39.03 --> 00:03:42.09
like Facebook, Tumblr,
other blogging platforms.

95
00:03:42.09 --> 00:03:44.07
And many third-party services

96
00:03:44.07 --> 00:03:47.07
can actually use the Google
ID for authentication.

97
00:03:47.07 --> 00:03:50.04
This can be useful when
people want to sign up

98
00:03:50.04 --> 00:03:52.09
for other websites or login.

99
00:03:52.09 --> 00:03:56.01
For example, I use Basecamp
as a project management tool

100
00:03:56.01 --> 00:03:59.03
and I'm able to simply
login with my Google ID,

101
00:03:59.03 --> 00:04:00.08
making it simpler so I don't have

102
00:04:00.08 --> 00:04:02.07
to set up yet another account,

103
00:04:02.07 --> 00:04:05.07
instead of managing
another set of passwords.

104
00:04:05.07 --> 00:04:09.00
If I can access my Google
device and I'm logged in,

105
00:04:09.00 --> 00:04:11.04
well, that gives me
access to many websites

106
00:04:11.04 --> 00:04:14.00
and not just those owned by Google.

107
00:04:14.00 --> 00:04:18.08
Now, in this case, what you
are seeing is a brand page.

108
00:04:18.08 --> 00:04:21.07
This would be not a Google
ID for an individual

109
00:04:21.07 --> 00:04:24.02
but rather for a company.

110
00:04:24.02 --> 00:04:27.09
In this case, here's an example
of a brand account page.

111
00:04:27.09 --> 00:04:30.03
But let me show you an individual page.

112
00:04:30.03 --> 00:04:33.08
If I'm logged into Google,
any of their websites,

113
00:04:33.08 --> 00:04:37.05
I can click on my profile here.

114
00:04:37.05 --> 00:04:41.05
And you see that I've
got my Google+ profile

115
00:04:41.05 --> 00:04:43.09
which is one way to connect and share

116
00:04:43.09 --> 00:04:46.07
and people can learn about me

117
00:04:46.07 --> 00:04:50.01
and this is where I
control what people see.

118
00:04:50.01 --> 00:04:53.08
So here is my About Me page for Google

119
00:04:53.08 --> 00:04:57.06
and this allows you to
actually see about someone.

120
00:04:57.06 --> 00:05:00.07
Here you can decide what
information is available,

121
00:05:00.07 --> 00:05:02.08
which contact information you share

122
00:05:02.08 --> 00:05:05.01
and, as you can see, you
can also include things

123
00:05:05.01 --> 00:05:09.08
like education and work history.

124
00:05:09.08 --> 00:05:12.07
You can also see where
you've been a contributor to

125
00:05:12.07 --> 00:05:15.06
or custom URLs that you want to share

126
00:05:15.06 --> 00:05:18.02
and other things such
as Google photo albums

127
00:05:18.02 --> 00:05:20.07
that you want to share or archive.

128
00:05:20.07 --> 00:05:22.03
So, this makes it pretty easy

129
00:05:22.03 --> 00:05:25.05
for that content to be distributed.

130
00:05:25.05 --> 00:05:27.03
For example, you can also
let other people know

131
00:05:27.03 --> 00:05:30.07
other cities that you've lived in.

132
00:05:30.07 --> 00:05:33.06
This is currently set to public.

133
00:05:33.06 --> 00:05:36.00
Now that same Google
ID will come into play

134
00:05:36.00 --> 00:05:38.06
when you access other applications.

135
00:05:38.06 --> 00:05:41.00
For example, here I'm
accessing Google Sheets

136
00:05:41.00 --> 00:05:42.05
on my mobile device

137
00:05:42.05 --> 00:05:45.03
and you'll see that several
different spreadsheets here

138
00:05:45.03 --> 00:05:49.05
are available to me, tied
to this particular account.

139
00:05:49.05 --> 00:05:51.07
If I tap the button here, you can see

140
00:05:51.07 --> 00:05:55.07
that I can have access to
multiple accounts on my device.

141
00:05:55.07 --> 00:05:58.03
So the same Google ID
that you use on YouTube

142
00:05:58.03 --> 00:06:01.08
is also used on many other services.

143
00:06:01.08 --> 00:06:04.09
Now, if somebody were to
visit your Google+ page

144
00:06:04.09 --> 00:06:06.09
or any other Google property

145
00:06:06.09 --> 00:06:09.02
and they click the About button,

146
00:06:09.02 --> 00:06:12.00
this is a similar thing
to what they'd see.

147
00:06:12.00 --> 00:06:15.01
Now, this looks a lot like
that page I showed you earlier

148
00:06:15.01 --> 00:06:19.02
for LinkedIn, but you see this
is about me as an individual

149
00:06:19.02 --> 00:06:21.02
and they can choose to invoke things

150
00:06:21.02 --> 00:06:23.07
like contacting me, for a hangout,

151
00:06:23.07 --> 00:06:25.07
calling my cellphone or calendar,

152
00:06:25.07 --> 00:06:29.00
but you see in my case,
I've blocked those out.

153
00:06:29.00 --> 00:06:31.03
While I like getting phone
calls from people I know,

154
00:06:31.03 --> 00:06:34.00
I choose not to let
people call me directly

155
00:06:34.00 --> 00:06:35.05
from Google's website.

156
00:06:35.05 --> 00:06:37.04
But if you don't turn that option off,

157
00:06:37.04 --> 00:06:39.00
and you fill in your phone number,

158
00:06:39.00 --> 00:06:41.04
you're putting that out
there for the world to see.

159
00:06:41.04 --> 00:06:44.09
So it's important that you
take control over that page,

160
00:06:44.09 --> 00:06:47.05
deciding what information is available.

161
00:06:47.05 --> 00:06:51.05
You can have a nice bio,
see additional information,

162
00:06:51.05 --> 00:06:54.05
and in this case, you
can see additional photos

163
00:06:54.05 --> 00:06:58.02
that I've shown and posts
that I've made on Google+.

164
00:06:58.02 --> 00:07:00.00
Here it's tying back to my blog,

165
00:07:00.00 --> 00:07:01.06
some of the content that I've re-shared

166
00:07:01.06 --> 00:07:03.08
on Google+ for people to enjoy.

167
00:07:03.08 --> 00:07:05.08
So, you can see, for
example, that it connects

168
00:07:05.08 --> 00:07:10.04
and starts to let you see
different types of imagery.

169
00:07:10.04 --> 00:07:12.06
All right, this is quite useful

170
00:07:12.06 --> 00:07:15.05
and having that account
profile is important.

171
00:07:15.05 --> 00:07:19.04
This is the Google ID
for you as an individual.

172
00:07:19.04 --> 00:07:21.02
I strongly suggest that you take the time

173
00:07:21.02 --> 00:07:22.08
to clean up your Google ID.

174
00:07:22.08 --> 00:07:25.05
Now, this is a little bit
beyond the focus of this class,

175
00:07:25.05 --> 00:07:28.08
but as you can see, it
contains a lot of information

176
00:07:28.08 --> 00:07:32.02
about you, the individual
and you should decide

177
00:07:32.02 --> 00:07:34.07
what you're comfortable
sharing and showing.

178
00:07:34.07 --> 00:07:37.08
But, fortunately, once you
create a YouTube channel,

179
00:07:37.08 --> 00:07:41.02
this Google ID isn't really
tied to the YouTube channel

180
00:07:41.02 --> 00:07:42.08
so it's ultimately up to you

181
00:07:42.08 --> 00:07:45.02
how present you are as an individual

182
00:07:45.02 --> 00:07:47.00
and how much visibility you take on.
