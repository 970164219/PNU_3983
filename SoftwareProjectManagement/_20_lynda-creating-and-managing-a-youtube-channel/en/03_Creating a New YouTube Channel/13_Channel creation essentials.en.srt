1
00:00:00.05 --> 00:00:01.08
- Now that you understand the difference

2
00:00:01.08 --> 00:00:04.06
between your Google ID
and your brand account,

3
00:00:04.06 --> 00:00:06.01
let's go through some of the essential

4
00:00:06.01 --> 00:00:11.04
strategies you need when
creating a new channel.

5
00:00:11.04 --> 00:00:13.01
Remember, with Channel Creation,

6
00:00:13.01 --> 00:00:14.07
it's pretty simple.

7
00:00:14.07 --> 00:00:17.01
Start by making sure you're logged-in

8
00:00:17.01 --> 00:00:20.04
to the correct account you want to use.

9
00:00:20.04 --> 00:00:24.01
Then, click your profile icon.

10
00:00:24.01 --> 00:00:27.02
Click Switch Account.

11
00:00:27.02 --> 00:00:29.05
And check if there's an existing account,

12
00:00:29.05 --> 00:00:32.07
if you want to add it.

13
00:00:32.07 --> 00:00:36.04
Or, check more accounts if you want to add

14
00:00:36.04 --> 00:00:40.01
a new one, or choose
from an existing brand.

15
00:00:40.01 --> 00:00:41.07
This'll be quite useful.

16
00:00:41.07 --> 00:00:43.09
Add Account will allow you to add

17
00:00:43.09 --> 00:00:46.09
a Google Channel based
on an existing brand

18
00:00:46.09 --> 00:00:48.04
that you're logged in to.

19
00:00:48.04 --> 00:00:50.01
And you might see this if you've never

20
00:00:50.01 --> 00:00:52.00
created a channel before.

21
00:00:52.00 --> 00:00:55.00
Otherwise, you can use
the More Accounts option

22
00:00:55.00 --> 00:00:56.09
to set up a custom account

23
00:00:56.09 --> 00:01:01.09
or a Google channel for a brand account.

24
00:01:01.09 --> 00:01:04.06
Remember, you'll see a screen like this

25
00:01:04.06 --> 00:01:07.01
where you can choose from existing brands

26
00:01:07.01 --> 00:01:09.03
or brand accounts that don't yet have

27
00:01:09.03 --> 00:01:11.09
a YouTube channel associated with them.

28
00:01:11.09 --> 00:01:14.01
Or, click the Plus button to create

29
00:01:14.01 --> 00:01:17.07
an all-new brand account.

30
00:01:17.07 --> 00:01:21.04
You'll be prompted to enter the name.

31
00:01:21.04 --> 00:01:24.00
And then the page is created.

32
00:01:24.00 --> 00:01:25.03
So, let's do this.

33
00:01:25.03 --> 00:01:28.06
To start, click on the
icon in the upper corner.

34
00:01:28.06 --> 00:01:32.00
You may see different accounts there.

35
00:01:32.00 --> 00:01:33.02
If you want to use the existing channel

36
00:01:33.02 --> 00:01:34.09
that was automatically created,

37
00:01:34.09 --> 00:01:37.01
just click Creator Studio.

38
00:01:37.01 --> 00:01:40.03
Or choose More Accounts.

39
00:01:40.03 --> 00:01:42.06
This'll take you to a page.

40
00:01:42.06 --> 00:01:45.05
Now I'm going to make a new account here,

41
00:01:45.05 --> 00:01:53.04
this time called Presets.photography.

42
00:01:53.04 --> 00:01:54.04
It's a new account where I'm going to be

43
00:01:54.04 --> 00:01:56.02
promoting photography presets

44
00:01:56.02 --> 00:01:58.08
for different software packages.

45
00:01:58.08 --> 00:02:01.08
And I'll click Create.

46
00:02:01.08 --> 00:02:03.09
It takes a moment, but then the new page

47
00:02:03.09 --> 00:02:07.02
is created and you land on it.

48
00:02:07.02 --> 00:02:09.02
You'll see a very generic page right now

49
00:02:09.02 --> 00:02:12.01
because there is no content uploaded yet,

50
00:02:12.01 --> 00:02:14.07
and no artwork whatsoever.

51
00:02:14.07 --> 00:02:17.04
However, we'll fix this in just a moment.

52
00:02:17.04 --> 00:02:20.02
Remember, you can have multiple channels

53
00:02:20.02 --> 00:02:22.04
tied to each brand account.

54
00:02:22.04 --> 00:02:24.00
So, if you don't want to use your

55
00:02:24.00 --> 00:02:26.04
personal presence on YouTube,

56
00:02:26.04 --> 00:02:28.07
make sure you set up a new brand account

57
00:02:28.07 --> 00:02:31.06
affiliated with your Google ID.

58
00:02:31.06 --> 00:02:34.02
If you skipped that section
earlier in the course,

59
00:02:34.02 --> 00:02:35.08
be sure to go back and watch it.

60
00:02:35.08 --> 00:02:37.09
Because there are a lot of subtle details.
