1
00:00:00.07 --> 00:00:03.01
- In order to give your
page a proper look,

2
00:00:03.01 --> 00:00:06.00
it's recommended that
you add some artwork.

3
00:00:06.00 --> 00:00:09.02
The generic person icon in a solid color

4
00:00:09.02 --> 00:00:12.01
probably doesn't really
establish your brand very well.

5
00:00:12.01 --> 00:00:14.04
It makes you look like it's a fake account

6
00:00:14.04 --> 00:00:17.04
or one that you couldn't
be bothered to set up.

7
00:00:17.04 --> 00:00:20.00
There are several pieces
of required artwork.

8
00:00:20.00 --> 00:00:22.04
I'm going to walk you
through what they are now,

9
00:00:22.04 --> 00:00:23.09
and a little bit later in the course,

10
00:00:23.09 --> 00:00:26.03
I'll show you how to make them.

11
00:00:26.03 --> 00:00:28.09
On a computer, sign into YouTube.

12
00:00:28.09 --> 00:00:35.05
Then click in the upper right
menu and choose My Channel.

13
00:00:35.05 --> 00:00:37.09
You'll see the option for new channel art

14
00:00:37.09 --> 00:00:39.07
near the top of the screen.

15
00:00:39.07 --> 00:00:43.00
You can click to add new channel art,

16
00:00:43.00 --> 00:00:45.08
or if you have existing
art, you can choose

17
00:00:45.08 --> 00:00:52.03
to modify the banner and
then choose Edit channel art.

18
00:00:52.03 --> 00:00:54.05
Generally speaking, when you're logged in,

19
00:00:54.05 --> 00:00:58.07
you'll see something like this.

20
00:00:58.07 --> 00:01:01.01
You'll then be presented
with a screen to upload

21
00:01:01.01 --> 00:01:06.04
or choose from existing content
you've already uploaded.

22
00:01:06.04 --> 00:01:09.03
Once you've uploaded it,
then you'll see a preview

23
00:01:09.03 --> 00:01:12.02
of how it looks across multiple devices.

24
00:01:12.02 --> 00:01:14.06
You can also choose to adjust the crop

25
00:01:14.06 --> 00:01:20.02
and then click the Select
button to store the edits.

26
00:01:20.02 --> 00:01:22.04
Some of the specs you need to keep in mind

27
00:01:22.04 --> 00:01:24.09
is that the channel art
is going to look different

28
00:01:24.09 --> 00:01:26.07
on different devices.

29
00:01:26.07 --> 00:01:29.03
This is why YouTube
provides a template file

30
00:01:29.03 --> 00:01:33.03
to make this a bit easier,
and we'll explore that later.

31
00:01:33.03 --> 00:01:37.07
Larger images tend to be
cropped, so for the best results,

32
00:01:37.07 --> 00:01:40.01
you're going to upload a single image

33
00:01:40.01 --> 00:01:47.09
that's 2,560 pixels by 1,440 pixels.

34
00:01:47.09 --> 00:01:49.02
This will allow the artwork

35
00:01:49.02 --> 00:01:52.07
to appear on the page and
give some branding to it.

36
00:01:52.07 --> 00:01:54.02
Let me show you how.

37
00:01:54.02 --> 00:01:56.01
Once you're logged into your page,

38
00:01:56.01 --> 00:01:58.07
you should see the individual channel.

39
00:01:58.07 --> 00:02:04.00
If you don't, click on your
icon and choose My channel.

40
00:02:04.00 --> 00:02:11.04
Now click the Customize button.

41
00:02:11.04 --> 00:02:14.07
You're now presented with
the look of your channel.

42
00:02:14.07 --> 00:02:17.08
If you've uploaded any
videos, these will be shown.

43
00:02:17.08 --> 00:02:21.03
Otherwise, it will show as empty.

44
00:02:21.03 --> 00:02:24.00
I'll click the Add Channel Art button.

45
00:02:24.00 --> 00:02:27.02
You can also click here on the pencil icon

46
00:02:27.02 --> 00:02:31.00
and choose to edit the channel art.

47
00:02:31.00 --> 00:02:33.09
This brings up a new dialogue.

48
00:02:33.09 --> 00:02:43.00
Now click to browse or
drag a new photo in.

49
00:02:43.00 --> 00:02:47.02
I've put together a few
samples in the exercise files,

50
00:02:47.02 --> 00:02:52.00
and I'll choose a sample image here.

51
00:02:52.00 --> 00:02:56.07
Let's just start with a
simple photo for a moment

52
00:02:56.07 --> 00:03:00.01
and we'll try this one here.

53
00:03:00.01 --> 00:03:02.08
I'll click Choose.

54
00:03:02.08 --> 00:03:05.05
The picture uploads, and
it will show it to me

55
00:03:05.05 --> 00:03:07.01
in the editing dialogue box

56
00:03:07.01 --> 00:03:09.02
if it meets the minimum resolution.

57
00:03:09.02 --> 00:03:11.09
Now if it's below, as
it was here, you'll see

58
00:03:11.09 --> 00:03:15.08
that it warns you that it's
not high enough resolution,

59
00:03:15.08 --> 00:03:18.07
so you'll need to find
a higher quality photo

60
00:03:18.07 --> 00:03:22.06
or use an image editing tool to resize it.

61
00:03:22.06 --> 00:03:25.06
Let's select again and this time,

62
00:03:25.06 --> 00:03:28.02
I'm going to choose the
one called Channel Art

63
00:03:28.02 --> 00:03:37.04
that I know is the right
size, and I'll click Choose.

64
00:03:37.04 --> 00:03:40.03
The file uploads and it
gives me a simulation

65
00:03:40.03 --> 00:03:43.09
of what it looks like on each device.

66
00:03:43.09 --> 00:03:48.03
You'll see a preview for
desktop, TV, and mobile.

67
00:03:48.03 --> 00:03:52.07
If I click Adjust the
crop, I can modify things,

68
00:03:52.07 --> 00:03:54.06
and you'll see as you do so,

69
00:03:54.06 --> 00:03:57.08
it's going to show you what it looks like.

70
00:03:57.08 --> 00:04:00.04
The inner box is what it's going to be

71
00:04:00.04 --> 00:04:03.08
on most devices for mobile.

72
00:04:03.08 --> 00:04:07.00
The outer box is how
it looks on televisions

73
00:04:07.00 --> 00:04:08.09
that are connected to YouTube.

74
00:04:08.09 --> 00:04:10.08
So keep in mind that televisions

75
00:04:10.08 --> 00:04:15.09
are going to need a 16
by nine aspect ratio.

76
00:04:15.09 --> 00:04:18.05
I'll go ahead and click Select here

77
00:04:18.05 --> 00:04:21.09
and the image is saved and uploaded.

78
00:04:21.09 --> 00:04:25.09
And you see that it places
it into the top of the bar,

79
00:04:25.09 --> 00:04:28.00
and that works quite nicely.

80
00:04:28.00 --> 00:04:32.05
While we're at it, let's
also upload the social icon.

81
00:04:32.05 --> 00:04:34.09
I'll click on the social icon here

82
00:04:34.09 --> 00:04:41.06
and choose to edit the channel.

83
00:04:41.06 --> 00:04:44.03
Let's choose to upload a file.

84
00:04:44.03 --> 00:04:46.00
I'll go to the same folder

85
00:04:46.00 --> 00:04:51.08
and choose a JPEG file in
this case and click Choose.

86
00:04:51.08 --> 00:04:53.06
The file is uploaded, and you'll see

87
00:04:53.06 --> 00:04:57.02
a similar choice for adjusting the crop.

88
00:04:57.02 --> 00:05:00.06
When satisfied, click Done,

89
00:05:00.06 --> 00:05:04.05
and you see it updates here
on your principal page.

90
00:05:04.05 --> 00:05:07.02
By the way, while you're
updating the icon here,

91
00:05:07.02 --> 00:05:09.08
you might want to also
change the banner artwork

92
00:05:09.08 --> 00:05:18.02
using the same artwork that
you put onto your YouTube page.

93
00:05:18.02 --> 00:05:22.02
And you see that it adds it
to your Google ID profile,

94
00:05:22.02 --> 00:05:26.08
or in this case, the
brand account profile.

95
00:05:26.08 --> 00:05:28.05
Now it's added.

96
00:05:28.05 --> 00:05:32.01
However, the challenge
here is that the logo

97
00:05:32.01 --> 00:05:35.09
is covering up the logo,
so what works on YouTube

98
00:05:35.09 --> 00:05:38.03
might not work on another page.

99
00:05:38.03 --> 00:05:46.00
So let's swap that out
and upload another image.

100
00:05:46.00 --> 00:05:48.02
And I'll go for the
generic version of that

101
00:05:48.02 --> 00:05:53.03
that doesn't have a logo built in

102
00:05:53.03 --> 00:05:57.03
and click Done, and it updates.

103
00:05:57.03 --> 00:05:59.08
So you want to be careful and keep in mind

104
00:05:59.08 --> 00:06:03.04
that artwork for YouTube
might not work on Google Plus

105
00:06:03.04 --> 00:06:05.03
and might not work on your brand account

106
00:06:05.03 --> 00:06:07.07
or personal account profile.

107
00:06:07.07 --> 00:06:10.09
But I'm satisfied now and we'll click OK.

108
00:06:10.09 --> 00:06:16.00
It updates and now let's
switch back to YouTube

109
00:06:16.00 --> 00:06:19.08
and I'll press refresh, and you see

110
00:06:19.08 --> 00:06:22.08
that the new look has been taken on.

111
00:06:22.08 --> 00:06:25.04
Now you might notice,
if you visit your page

112
00:06:25.04 --> 00:06:28.07
on a mobile device, that the
artwork may take a moment

113
00:06:28.07 --> 00:06:31.08
to propagate across all platforms.

114
00:06:31.08 --> 00:06:34.02
Just because you see it on one device

115
00:06:34.02 --> 00:06:36.07
doesn't mean you'll see it on another.

116
00:06:36.07 --> 00:06:39.07
Google serves up things
at multiple resolutions,

117
00:06:39.07 --> 00:06:42.00
so be prepared to wait a little bit

118
00:06:42.00 --> 00:06:44.08
for your artwork to make it
all the way through the system

119
00:06:44.08 --> 00:06:46.00
if you customize it.
