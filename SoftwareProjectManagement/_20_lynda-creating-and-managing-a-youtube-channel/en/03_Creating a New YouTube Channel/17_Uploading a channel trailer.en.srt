1
00:00:00.04 --> 00:00:04.00
- Another thing that you can
add to a page is a trailer.

2
00:00:04.00 --> 00:00:06.06
This is a video that gives people an idea

3
00:00:06.06 --> 00:00:09.00
about your products or your company.

4
00:00:09.00 --> 00:00:11.05
Now, here's a couple pieces of advice.

5
00:00:11.05 --> 00:00:13.04
Consider when you create this trailer

6
00:00:13.04 --> 00:00:16.03
that it advertises your
particular channel,

7
00:00:16.03 --> 00:00:19.07
and is there to entice
people to subscribe.

8
00:00:19.07 --> 00:00:22.04
Remember, subscriptions are free.

9
00:00:22.04 --> 00:00:25.04
Try to consider the audience's motivation.

10
00:00:25.04 --> 00:00:27.09
What's gonna drive them
to like your channel

11
00:00:27.09 --> 00:00:29.04
or come back?

12
00:00:29.04 --> 00:00:32.02
And be sure to include a call to action,

13
00:00:32.02 --> 00:00:34.07
driving people to subscribe.

14
00:00:34.07 --> 00:00:38.01
Be sure to emphasize that
subscriptions on Youtube are free.

15
00:00:38.01 --> 00:00:41.07
Now there are ways for people
to pay to be a fan of yours

16
00:00:41.07 --> 00:00:44.03
if you have a certain style
of account on Youtube,

17
00:00:44.03 --> 00:00:48.00
but generally speaking, when
we say "subscribe on Youtube",

18
00:00:48.00 --> 00:00:49.09
that's a free subscription.

19
00:00:49.09 --> 00:00:52.00
And the key benefit here is it ensures

20
00:00:52.00 --> 00:00:54.07
that they won't miss out
on any of the content

21
00:00:54.07 --> 00:00:57.06
or the items that you release.

22
00:00:57.06 --> 00:01:01.03
Now, let me take a moment and
show you a sample trailer.

23
00:01:01.03 --> 00:01:03.07
This is one that we
produced a few years back

24
00:01:03.07 --> 00:01:06.02
for a company called
Adorama-- it's a retail store

25
00:01:06.02 --> 00:01:08.06
that has their own
products, and also carries

26
00:01:08.06 --> 00:01:11.03
many other camera products,
and they put together

27
00:01:11.03 --> 00:01:14.07
an extensive Youtube channel
that informs and educates

28
00:01:14.07 --> 00:01:17.09
folks on how to get more
from their photography.

29
00:01:17.09 --> 00:01:20.06
So, the trailer tries to
entice you with a little bit

30
00:01:20.06 --> 00:01:22.05
of humor to become a fan.

31
00:01:22.05 --> 00:01:24.06
(jazzy music)

32
00:01:24.06 --> 00:01:26.01
(bell dings)

33
00:01:26.01 --> 00:01:27.05
- [Narrator] Meet Bill.

34
00:01:27.05 --> 00:01:31.00
(jaunty music)
Bill likes photography.

35
00:01:31.00 --> 00:01:35.00
Bill wants to make great photos.

36
00:01:35.00 --> 00:01:36.00
(camera shutter snaps)

37
00:01:36.00 --> 00:01:39.01
But Bill could use some help.
(camera shutter snapping)

38
00:01:39.01 --> 00:01:43.01
Adorama TV has everything
a photographer needs.

39
00:01:43.01 --> 00:01:46.09
Bill can watch tutorials
with world-renowned experts,

40
00:01:46.09 --> 00:01:50.08
and get tips on the best
gear, and how to use it.

41
00:01:50.08 --> 00:01:53.04
(bell dings)

42
00:01:53.04 --> 00:01:59.00
Now Bill makes great photos,
and has fun doing it.

43
00:01:59.00 --> 00:02:01.00
(camera shutter snaps)

44
00:02:01.00 --> 00:02:02.08
Bill is one smart cookie.

45
00:02:02.08 --> 00:02:04.00
(twinkle)

46
00:02:04.00 --> 00:02:07.06
Subscribe to Adorama TV to get
the latest photography tips

47
00:02:07.06 --> 00:02:09.04
and tutorials.

48
00:02:09.04 --> 00:02:11.08
Brought to you by Adorama,

49
00:02:11.08 --> 00:02:14.09
more than a camera store.

50
00:02:14.09 --> 00:02:16.03
(twinkle)

51
00:02:16.03 --> 00:02:19.01
- In that case, that was
a full-on commercial,

52
00:02:19.01 --> 00:02:22.02
and the company's Youtube
channel was a key component

53
00:02:22.02 --> 00:02:26.02
of their email-based and
internet marketing strategy.

54
00:02:26.02 --> 00:02:29.04
As such, they had a budget to
produce a decent commercial

55
00:02:29.04 --> 00:02:31.01
about their Youtube channel.

56
00:02:31.01 --> 00:02:34.05
But even a simple personal
introduction from you,

57
00:02:34.05 --> 00:02:38.06
the channel host, or perhaps
a slideshow set to music,

58
00:02:38.06 --> 00:02:42.01
or edited clips as a
montage about what your show

59
00:02:42.01 --> 00:02:45.02
or channel is about is a
great way to give people

60
00:02:45.02 --> 00:02:46.07
information.

61
00:02:46.07 --> 00:02:49.05
You also have the ability to
decide to show the trailer

62
00:02:49.05 --> 00:02:53.01
to people only before they subscribe.

63
00:02:53.01 --> 00:02:56.05
This way, the trailer is shown
to potential subscribers,

64
00:02:56.05 --> 00:02:59.01
but not shown to people
after they subscribe

65
00:02:59.01 --> 00:03:01.02
to your channel.

66
00:03:01.02 --> 00:03:03.05
To do this is pretty simple.

67
00:03:03.05 --> 00:03:05.06
Let me show you where to set this.

68
00:03:05.06 --> 00:03:08.08
I've switched to a page that
already has a video uploaded.

69
00:03:08.08 --> 00:03:11.04
In order to set a trailer,
you'll need to have uploaded

70
00:03:11.04 --> 00:03:13.02
a video already.

71
00:03:13.02 --> 00:03:17.05
Go to your channel and then
click "customize channel."

72
00:03:17.05 --> 00:03:20.08
Click on the "For new visitors" tab

73
00:03:20.08 --> 00:03:25.01
and you can now choose
to add a channel trailer.

74
00:03:25.01 --> 00:03:28.00
You can choose from any
video you've already uploaded

75
00:03:28.00 --> 00:03:30.06
and click "Save."

76
00:03:30.06 --> 00:03:32.09
Now it's shown.

77
00:03:32.09 --> 00:03:35.09
You'll notice that returning subscribers

78
00:03:35.09 --> 00:03:38.07
may not see the trailer,
they'll see what video

79
00:03:38.07 --> 00:03:40.03
is uploaded next.

80
00:03:40.03 --> 00:03:43.09
In this case I only have
one, so it does show as well,

81
00:03:43.09 --> 00:03:46.07
but for new subscribers,
they're gonna be presented

82
00:03:46.07 --> 00:03:48.00
with that video.

83
00:03:48.00 --> 00:03:50.08
So you can decide to feature a video here,

84
00:03:50.08 --> 00:03:54.00
or have a trailer, and it'll
be prominently shown to people

85
00:03:54.00 --> 00:03:57.04
for the first time they visit
your page until they click

86
00:03:57.04 --> 00:03:59.04
the Subscribe button.

87
00:03:59.04 --> 00:04:02.03
Then, once they've done
that, it'll go away.

88
00:04:02.03 --> 00:04:06.09
So let's go ahead here and
customize this really quick.

89
00:04:06.09 --> 00:04:12.02
I'll just go ahead and view
this as a returning subscriber,

90
00:04:12.02 --> 00:04:15.09
and you see that there
is no trailer shown.

91
00:04:15.09 --> 00:04:19.02
The use of a trailer is a
great way to prompt people

92
00:04:19.02 --> 00:04:21.05
to take action and to subscribe.

93
00:04:21.05 --> 00:04:23.03
And as you'll learn
later when we talk about

94
00:04:23.03 --> 00:04:26.02
managing your audience,
driving subscriptions

95
00:04:26.02 --> 00:04:30.02
is an important way to
engage with your audience.
