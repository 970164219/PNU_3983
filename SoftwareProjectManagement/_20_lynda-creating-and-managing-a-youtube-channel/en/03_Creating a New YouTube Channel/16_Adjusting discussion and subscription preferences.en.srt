1
00:00:00.05 --> 00:00:02.04
- Another area that you
need to take a look at

2
00:00:02.04 --> 00:00:05.05
is how you control the
settings for discussion

3
00:00:05.05 --> 00:00:07.01
about your channel.

4
00:00:07.01 --> 00:00:09.02
Now, personally, I like to see discussion

5
00:00:09.02 --> 00:00:11.00
on individual videos

6
00:00:11.00 --> 00:00:13.08
but I'm not interested in
having comments available

7
00:00:13.08 --> 00:00:15.02
on the channel itself

8
00:00:15.02 --> 00:00:18.04
where people discuss
the channel as a whole.

9
00:00:18.04 --> 00:00:20.04
However, some people may want this.

10
00:00:20.04 --> 00:00:22.05
It does tend to be a place, though,

11
00:00:22.05 --> 00:00:24.02
where your harshest critics will gather

12
00:00:24.02 --> 00:00:26.08
and post things for everyone to see.

13
00:00:26.08 --> 00:00:28.07
Let me show you how you can control this.

14
00:00:28.07 --> 00:00:31.01
First up, the channel discussion

15
00:00:31.01 --> 00:00:33.02
is going to be done under the gear icon

16
00:00:33.02 --> 00:00:35.01
in the top right corner of the page.

17
00:00:35.01 --> 00:00:37.05
This controls whether people can comment

18
00:00:37.05 --> 00:00:41.01
on a channel as a whole.

19
00:00:41.01 --> 00:00:45.02
What you can do is sign in
and then click on My Channel

20
00:00:45.02 --> 00:00:48.05
and go to your channel banner.

21
00:00:48.05 --> 00:00:52.04
Click the settings icon.

22
00:00:52.04 --> 00:00:55.02
Sign in on your computer
and then click on your icon

23
00:00:55.02 --> 00:00:58.00
and choose my channel.

24
00:00:58.00 --> 00:01:00.04
Under the channel banner,
you'll see a choice

25
00:01:00.04 --> 00:01:02.08
for settings, a gear icon.

26
00:01:02.08 --> 00:01:04.06
Click it and you can now decide

27
00:01:04.06 --> 00:01:09.04
to show the discussion tab
and make things on or off.

28
00:01:09.04 --> 00:01:11.07
If you do turn this on, you can decide

29
00:01:11.07 --> 00:01:14.02
that you'd like to show
comments automatically

30
00:01:14.02 --> 00:01:17.09
without moderation or wait
until you've had a chance

31
00:01:17.09 --> 00:01:20.06
to login and approve them.

32
00:01:20.06 --> 00:01:23.05
Comments will not be
available on private videos

33
00:01:23.05 --> 00:01:25.07
so if you don't want to
allow commenting on a video

34
00:01:25.07 --> 00:01:29.01
that's publicly available,
make sure you post it

35
00:01:29.01 --> 00:01:34.05
as an unlisted video.

36
00:01:34.05 --> 00:01:35.04
Now, let's go to the channel

37
00:01:35.04 --> 00:01:37.09
and I'll click the
customize channel button

38
00:01:37.09 --> 00:01:40.05
to make sure it's editable.

39
00:01:40.05 --> 00:01:45.04
You'll now see the gear
icon and simply click.

40
00:01:45.04 --> 00:01:49.03
You can decide if you want
to show the discussions tab.

41
00:01:49.03 --> 00:01:53.05
Let's close this for a moment
and you'll see discussions.

42
00:01:53.05 --> 00:01:56.09
This is where people can post comments.

43
00:01:56.09 --> 00:01:59.04
If you don't want
discussions on the main page,

44
00:01:59.04 --> 00:02:03.00
click that icon again
and choose to disable it

45
00:02:03.00 --> 00:02:05.00
and it will go away.

46
00:02:05.00 --> 00:02:07.02
Remember, if it's enabled, you can decide

47
00:02:07.02 --> 00:02:11.05
to display automatically
or to moderate them.

48
00:02:11.05 --> 00:02:18.06
I'm gonna turn it off at the
channel level and click save.

49
00:02:18.06 --> 00:02:22.05
You'll see that the
discussions tab goes away.

50
00:02:22.05 --> 00:02:25.02
Now, if you do decide
to enable discussions,

51
00:02:25.02 --> 00:02:27.08
let me give you a few pieces of advice.

52
00:02:27.08 --> 00:02:31.02
First up, make sure that
you choose whether or not

53
00:02:31.02 --> 00:02:33.00
to display them.

54
00:02:33.00 --> 00:02:37.00
I do not recommend being
automatically displayed.

55
00:02:37.00 --> 00:02:38.08
Rather, I would strongly suggest

56
00:02:38.08 --> 00:02:41.05
that if you choose to show
comments on your page,

57
00:02:41.05 --> 00:02:46.05
that you set these to be
only approved comments.

58
00:02:46.05 --> 00:02:48.09
Also, I would recommend
that those comments

59
00:02:48.09 --> 00:02:50.07
are reviewed by either you

60
00:02:50.07 --> 00:02:52.06
or one of the communications manager

61
00:02:52.06 --> 00:02:54.09
before you make them live.

62
00:02:54.09 --> 00:02:57.03
This gives you a chance
to respond to people

63
00:02:57.03 --> 00:03:00.07
and to decide if the comment
adds to the discussion

64
00:03:00.07 --> 00:03:04.06
or is simply somebody venting.

65
00:03:04.06 --> 00:03:06.06
Now, in my own personal experience,

66
00:03:06.06 --> 00:03:08.08
YouTube commenters typically exhibit

67
00:03:08.08 --> 00:03:10.07
some of the worst writing skills.

68
00:03:10.07 --> 00:03:14.09
What it comes down to is make
sure that you're in control.

69
00:03:14.09 --> 00:03:17.03
If this is a brand that matters to you,

70
00:03:17.03 --> 00:03:20.01
you might not want to give
people a free for all.

71
00:03:20.01 --> 00:03:22.03
I'm all for social media and engagement

72
00:03:22.03 --> 00:03:23.08
but think of it this way.

73
00:03:23.08 --> 00:03:26.05
Would you let somebody stand
in the lobby of your building

74
00:03:26.05 --> 00:03:29.03
or the front entryway
screaming negative things?

75
00:03:29.03 --> 00:03:31.00
Probably not.

76
00:03:31.00 --> 00:03:34.05
It can be really distracting
to other customers or visitors.

77
00:03:34.05 --> 00:03:38.02
Now it's fine to see those
comments if they're moderated

78
00:03:38.02 --> 00:03:42.01
and reply to the person as a
customer service opportunity.

79
00:03:42.01 --> 00:03:45.03
So, if you're prepared to
monitor these comments,

80
00:03:45.03 --> 00:03:49.07
turn on the discussion tab but
set them to approval first.

81
00:03:49.07 --> 00:03:51.07
This way, you can get
the negative feedback

82
00:03:51.07 --> 00:03:54.08
and engage the customer
to make them satisfied.

83
00:03:54.08 --> 00:03:56.09
If you don't have time to moderate this

84
00:03:56.09 --> 00:03:59.06
and you don't want to get
customer support complaints

85
00:03:59.06 --> 00:04:02.02
through YouTube, then turn it off

86
00:04:02.02 --> 00:04:05.00
and just make sure that you
have a feedback mechanism

87
00:04:05.00 --> 00:04:07.01
on your company's website.

88
00:04:07.01 --> 00:04:09.08
Now, couple more things
to look at for settings.

89
00:04:09.08 --> 00:04:12.03
I would also suggest that you take a look

90
00:04:12.03 --> 00:04:14.01
at your privacy settings.

91
00:04:14.01 --> 00:04:18.05
Remember, this controls what's
going to be shown to people.

92
00:04:18.05 --> 00:04:23.09
I generally recommend that
these should be disabled.

93
00:04:23.09 --> 00:04:26.03
And take a look at your notifications

94
00:04:26.03 --> 00:04:29.04
to understand what's going
to be put out to people

95
00:04:29.04 --> 00:04:31.03
when you publish.

96
00:04:31.03 --> 00:04:35.04
So, if we go here to our settings icon,

97
00:04:35.04 --> 00:04:38.03
I'm gonna leave things set to private here

98
00:04:38.03 --> 00:04:40.07
so all of my playlists, subscriptions

99
00:04:40.07 --> 00:04:42.08
and viewed videos are private

100
00:04:42.08 --> 00:04:45.07
and if I want other controls, I can click

101
00:04:45.07 --> 00:04:47.08
to access advanced settings.

102
00:04:47.08 --> 00:04:51.05
And this will let me
control what is shared.

103
00:04:51.05 --> 00:04:54.03
So, for example, I'm gonna keep all

104
00:04:54.03 --> 00:04:56.08
of my liked videos private.

105
00:04:56.08 --> 00:05:00.03
And I'm not going to post
to the activity feed.

106
00:05:00.03 --> 00:05:04.05
This way, I don't get
accidental posts on my content.

107
00:05:04.05 --> 00:05:07.08
Additionally, if I click
the notification icon here,

108
00:05:07.08 --> 00:05:11.07
I can control, if there are
any notifications coming in

109
00:05:11.07 --> 00:05:13.05
and I can click the gear icon here

110
00:05:13.05 --> 00:05:15.04
to see the settings and, you see,

111
00:05:15.04 --> 00:05:18.05
it let's me control
what I'm notified about.

112
00:05:18.05 --> 00:05:22.08
So, for example, I can get
emails about all of my activity

113
00:05:22.08 --> 00:05:28.01
or only do ones that are
required announcements.

114
00:05:28.01 --> 00:05:31.02
You see that this affects
what you get notified on,

115
00:05:31.02 --> 00:05:35.09
everything or only specific things.

116
00:05:35.09 --> 00:05:38.05
You can decide what you're
gonna get notified on.

117
00:05:38.05 --> 00:05:42.09
Do you want to get a push
message or an email or both?

118
00:05:42.09 --> 00:05:46.04
And this will show you up
here, as a push message,

119
00:05:46.04 --> 00:05:49.09
in the mobile app and in your email.

120
00:05:49.09 --> 00:05:53.01
And you can decide if you want
to get notified about things.

121
00:05:53.01 --> 00:05:55.08
For example, I don't
really care about activity

122
00:05:55.08 --> 00:05:59.02
on my channel or my comments

123
00:05:59.02 --> 00:06:03.06
but I do want to know about
replies to my comments.

124
00:06:03.06 --> 00:06:07.04
This way I get notified if I
need to respond to somebody

125
00:06:07.04 --> 00:06:10.01
after they've replied to me.

126
00:06:10.01 --> 00:06:13.07
In any case, you're in control
of what you get notified on

127
00:06:13.07 --> 00:06:16.09
and what information
you share with people.

128
00:06:16.09 --> 00:06:18.04
Remember, this is important

129
00:06:18.04 --> 00:06:24.06
because as you go back
to your channel here,

130
00:06:24.06 --> 00:06:27.04
this will affect what
information is going to appear

131
00:06:27.04 --> 00:06:30.05
in the stream and what
notifications people

132
00:06:30.05 --> 00:06:34.01
are told about as you start to
engage with YouTube content.
