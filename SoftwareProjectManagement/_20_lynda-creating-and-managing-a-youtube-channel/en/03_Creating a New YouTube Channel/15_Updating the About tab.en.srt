1
00:00:00.02 --> 00:00:01.08
- Once you have some artwork in place,

2
00:00:01.08 --> 00:00:04.01
you probably want to
fill in the about tab,

3
00:00:04.01 --> 00:00:06.05
which tells people about your channel.

4
00:00:06.05 --> 00:00:08.06
This is pretty straight forward.

5
00:00:08.06 --> 00:00:12.03
First up, add a description
about your site.

6
00:00:12.03 --> 00:00:15.01
Be sure to also include
any contact information

7
00:00:15.01 --> 00:00:17.00
if you want people to
get in touch with you

8
00:00:17.00 --> 00:00:19.04
for business purposes.

9
00:00:19.04 --> 00:00:22.02
And you can specify a
location to make it easier

10
00:00:22.02 --> 00:00:25.07
to find your business, if this matters.

11
00:00:25.07 --> 00:00:28.00
Also, you can add any relevant links

12
00:00:28.00 --> 00:00:30.01
that you want people to know about.

13
00:00:30.01 --> 00:00:34.00
This can be easily added
on the page itself.

14
00:00:34.00 --> 00:00:38.01
Let's go ahead and
modify a few things here.

15
00:00:38.01 --> 00:00:40.08
On the page, all I need to do

16
00:00:40.08 --> 00:00:44.00
is switch over to the about tab.

17
00:00:44.00 --> 00:00:47.09
Now, it asks me for information.

18
00:00:47.09 --> 00:00:50.05
Click to add a channel description.

19
00:00:50.05 --> 00:00:53.09
I've included a text file that
you can use to copy and paste

20
00:00:53.09 --> 00:00:55.09
if you'd like to follow along.

21
00:00:55.09 --> 00:00:59.02
Or, feel free to sit back and watch.

22
00:00:59.02 --> 00:01:01.00
At the bottom is a link
if you'd like to see

23
00:01:01.00 --> 00:01:03.03
how this description
appears on other websites

24
00:01:03.03 --> 00:01:05.02
that Googles owns.

25
00:01:05.02 --> 00:01:07.08
This'll take you to a page
with a support article

26
00:01:07.08 --> 00:01:10.05
that explains how the
different things are used.

27
00:01:10.05 --> 00:01:13.03
So, there's the channel description

28
00:01:13.03 --> 00:01:16.09
and it gives you a little bit
of additional information.

29
00:01:16.09 --> 00:01:19.03
Now, let's keep going.

30
00:01:19.03 --> 00:01:22.06
Under details here, I can
choose to add an email

31
00:01:22.06 --> 00:01:24.05
for business inquiries.

32
00:01:24.05 --> 00:01:30.06
I can also specify a country for business.

33
00:01:30.06 --> 00:01:37.06
And, let's add an external website.

34
00:01:37.06 --> 00:01:40.01
This is the same user
interface you saw before

35
00:01:40.01 --> 00:01:49.08
where up to five links can
be included on the page.

36
00:01:49.08 --> 00:01:53.02
Let's copy the URL

37
00:01:53.02 --> 00:01:57.04
and I'll attempt to add it in.

38
00:01:57.04 --> 00:01:59.01
There we go.

39
00:01:59.01 --> 00:02:00.06
And now it's added.

40
00:02:00.06 --> 00:02:03.02
And you'll notice that it
actually took the favicon

41
00:02:03.02 --> 00:02:05.06
that was set at the website level.

42
00:02:05.06 --> 00:02:08.02
So, if you take the time to add a favicon

43
00:02:08.02 --> 00:02:11.01
using WordPress or your
other hosting platform,

44
00:02:11.01 --> 00:02:14.02
it will pick up the custom icon.

45
00:02:14.02 --> 00:02:18.05
Alright, let's click done.

46
00:02:18.05 --> 00:02:20.05
And you'll notice that I'm
getting a warning here,

47
00:02:20.05 --> 00:02:22.09
that there's too much information.

48
00:02:22.09 --> 00:02:25.08
Well, you are limited to
a thousand characters here

49
00:02:25.08 --> 00:02:30.02
so, if needed, you might
have to actually remove some.

50
00:02:30.02 --> 00:02:32.06
Then it stores it.

51
00:02:32.06 --> 00:02:35.04
Now, you'll see that the
website has been added

52
00:02:35.04 --> 00:02:37.05
to my top navigation.

53
00:02:37.05 --> 00:02:39.07
Everything else is stored.

54
00:02:39.07 --> 00:02:45.06
Now, let's go ahead and view
the channel as a subscriber.

55
00:02:45.06 --> 00:02:48.07
I can see how it will look to them,

56
00:02:48.07 --> 00:02:50.09
the logo is there,

57
00:02:50.09 --> 00:02:52.08
the artwork is loaded,

58
00:02:52.08 --> 00:02:56.09
there's my link for the
website and it looks good.

59
00:02:56.09 --> 00:03:00.04
Alright, the page is populating.

60
00:03:00.04 --> 00:03:02.07
Remember, later on I'll walk you through

61
00:03:02.07 --> 00:03:05.00
some of the strategies
for creating that artwork

62
00:03:05.00 --> 00:03:07.05
using a tool like Adobe Photoshop.

63
00:03:07.05 --> 00:03:11.02
But, as you see, once you've
got a banner artwork uploaded

64
00:03:11.02 --> 00:03:14.05
and a icon for you as a channel,

65
00:03:14.05 --> 00:03:16.03
it's going to take on a whole new life

66
00:03:16.03 --> 00:03:18.08
and that page starts to look a lot better.
