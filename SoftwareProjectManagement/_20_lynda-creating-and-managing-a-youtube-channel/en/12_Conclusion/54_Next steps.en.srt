1
00:00:00.06 --> 00:00:03.02
- I'd like to thank you for
joining me on this journey.

2
00:00:03.02 --> 00:00:06.01
There's a lot to putting
together a good YouTube channel.

3
00:00:06.01 --> 00:00:09.06
And as such, we've had to go
through many different topics.

4
00:00:09.06 --> 00:00:13.01
I fully expect that you
have even more questions.

5
00:00:13.01 --> 00:00:14.07
I would suggest a few things

6
00:00:14.07 --> 00:00:16.06
to help you complete your education

7
00:00:16.06 --> 00:00:19.00
and succeed at building your channel.

8
00:00:19.00 --> 00:00:22.05
First up, don't be
afraid of the Help menu.

9
00:00:22.05 --> 00:00:25.08
Visiting YouTube's Support
page is a good idea.

10
00:00:25.08 --> 00:00:28.02
YouTube frequently changes things,

11
00:00:28.02 --> 00:00:31.08
adding features, subtracting
features, moving features.

12
00:00:31.08 --> 00:00:34.04
I find myself opening up the Support page

13
00:00:34.04 --> 00:00:36.06
just about every time
I want to do something

14
00:00:36.06 --> 00:00:40.03
in-depth on my channel
beyond just uploading a video

15
00:00:40.03 --> 00:00:42.02
or moving something around.

16
00:00:42.02 --> 00:00:44.02
YouTube has a lot of great features

17
00:00:44.02 --> 00:00:46.05
and a lot of new things
that keep popping up.

18
00:00:46.05 --> 00:00:48.07
So if you don't read the Support articles

19
00:00:48.07 --> 00:00:50.05
or the blog on YouTube's site,

20
00:00:50.05 --> 00:00:52.01
you might miss out on those.

21
00:00:52.01 --> 00:00:53.04
So make sure you pay attention

22
00:00:53.04 --> 00:00:55.09
because there are lots of
developments that pop up

23
00:00:55.09 --> 00:00:59.06
that might be beta or might
be implemented for real.

24
00:00:59.06 --> 00:01:01.00
Additionally, we covered a lot

25
00:01:01.00 --> 00:01:03.05
of related skills during this class,

26
00:01:03.05 --> 00:01:07.05
topics like video compression
and graphics and branding.

27
00:01:07.05 --> 00:01:09.02
Well as such, you might want to explore

28
00:01:09.02 --> 00:01:12.07
some of the other courses
available in the online library.

29
00:01:12.07 --> 00:01:15.00
I also have a course all about producing

30
00:01:15.00 --> 00:01:16.05
webinars and events,

31
00:01:16.05 --> 00:01:18.04
and there are some live streaming courses

32
00:01:18.04 --> 00:01:20.03
that are quite useful as well.

33
00:01:20.03 --> 00:01:22.08
Check these out if you'd like
to learn more on these topics

34
00:01:22.08 --> 00:01:24.04
and go a lot deeper.

35
00:01:24.04 --> 00:01:27.03
But all in all, YouTube is a platform.

36
00:01:27.03 --> 00:01:29.04
It's a platform for your content,

37
00:01:29.04 --> 00:01:31.05
and you have to remember that good content

38
00:01:31.05 --> 00:01:33.09
is what's going to work on YouTube.

39
00:01:33.09 --> 00:01:35.06
So just knowing how to make a channel

40
00:01:35.06 --> 00:01:37.09
with pretty thumbnails
and great descriptions

41
00:01:37.09 --> 00:01:39.09
and good tags is one thing.

42
00:01:39.09 --> 00:01:42.04
But if you don't have
content that's engaging,

43
00:01:42.04 --> 00:01:44.02
well, it's not going to work.

44
00:01:44.02 --> 00:01:46.05
So make sure you balance
out your creativity

45
00:01:46.05 --> 00:01:49.00
and storytelling
abilities with the ability

46
00:01:49.00 --> 00:01:51.03
to use a great database, tag structure,

47
00:01:51.03 --> 00:01:53.03
and search engine optimization.

48
00:01:53.03 --> 00:01:55.00
And if that seems a little bit difficult,

49
00:01:55.00 --> 00:01:56.09
don't be afraid to partner with people

50
00:01:56.09 --> 00:01:58.03
and get some help.

51
00:01:58.03 --> 00:02:01.06
Fortunately, YouTube has
become a very viable platform,

52
00:02:01.06 --> 00:02:03.01
and there are a lot of resources

53
00:02:03.01 --> 00:02:05.08
to continue to learn it and master it.

54
00:02:05.08 --> 00:02:07.01
My name's Rich Harrington.

55
00:02:07.01 --> 00:02:08.01
Thanks for watching.
