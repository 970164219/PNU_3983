00:00:00.06 --> 00:00:03.04
- Hi, my name's Rich Harrington
and welcome to this course

2
00:00:03.04 --> 00:00:06.09
where we'll explore creating
and managing a YouTube channel.

3
00:00:06.09 --> 00:00:09.06
There's an awful lot to
cover and we've got many

4
00:00:09.06 --> 00:00:11.07
different areas we're going to look at.

5
00:00:11.07 --> 00:00:13.07
Now, in order to succeed in this course,

6
00:00:13.07 --> 00:00:17.00
you'll need to be able to
master many different skills.

7
00:00:17.00 --> 00:00:19.02
There are parts that are super easy,

8
00:00:19.02 --> 00:00:22.03
and then there are parts that
are a bit more difficult.

9
00:00:22.03 --> 00:00:24.06
Adding to the complexity,
is the fact also,

10
00:00:24.06 --> 00:00:27.09
that YouTube is frequently in transition.

11
00:00:27.09 --> 00:00:30.05
For example, they've been in
the middle of a beta process

12
00:00:30.05 --> 00:00:33.00
that's lasted almost two
years as they're starting

13
00:00:33.00 --> 00:00:35.08
to completely change the user interface.

14
00:00:35.08 --> 00:00:37.03
As such, during this course,

15
00:00:37.03 --> 00:00:41.00
I'll often show you two different
ways to do the same thing.

16
00:00:41.00 --> 00:00:43.04
Now the key thing to
remember here is that change

17
00:00:43.04 --> 00:00:46.06
is inevitable and Google
adds and subtracts features

18
00:00:46.06 --> 00:00:48.04
from YouTube all the time.

19
00:00:48.04 --> 00:00:51.00
But the core skills we cover
in this course are going to

20
00:00:51.00 --> 00:00:53.07
be useful to you even as the software

21
00:00:53.07 --> 00:00:56.07
and the website goes through
many different changes.

22
00:00:56.07 --> 00:00:58.07
So what exactly are you going to learn?

23
00:00:58.07 --> 00:01:00.07
We'll start things off
by making sure you have

24
00:01:00.07 --> 00:01:03.08
a thorough understanding of
what a YouTube channel can do.

25
00:01:03.08 --> 00:01:06.00
What are the benefits and
some of the potential things

26
00:01:06.00 --> 00:01:08.07
you need to keep an eye
on in order to succeed.

27
00:01:08.07 --> 00:01:11.09
We'll then talk about
Google IDs which is used

28
00:01:11.09 --> 00:01:14.03
at the individual level
to control your presence

29
00:01:14.03 --> 00:01:17.06
on Google properties like
YouTube, as well as other sites

30
00:01:17.06 --> 00:01:19.09
such as Google Plus and Google Photos,

31
00:01:19.09 --> 00:01:21.07
as well as Google Maps.

32
00:01:21.07 --> 00:01:24.06
Plus we'll explore the
use of a brand account

33
00:01:24.06 --> 00:01:27.02
so multiple people can control a website

34
00:01:27.02 --> 00:01:29.07
or that you can actually
brand your YouTube channel

35
00:01:29.07 --> 00:01:33.03
differently than you as an individual.

36
00:01:33.03 --> 00:01:34.08
We'll then walk you through the process

37
00:01:34.08 --> 00:01:37.00
of creating a new YouTube channel.

38
00:01:37.00 --> 00:01:39.05
You can create one channel
or multiple channels

39
00:01:39.05 --> 00:01:42.09
if you take advantage
of those brand accounts.

40
00:01:42.09 --> 00:01:45.02
I'll then make sure you
understand what's necessary

41
00:01:45.02 --> 00:01:47.00
to create channel artwork.

42
00:01:47.00 --> 00:01:49.09
This is going to be the graphics
that you use on the page

43
00:01:49.09 --> 00:01:53.03
and within videos to
successfully establish your brand

44
00:01:53.03 --> 00:01:56.05
so people can find you again,
as well as to reinforce

45
00:01:56.05 --> 00:02:00.04
other things about you or your channel.

46
00:02:00.04 --> 00:02:02.03
We'll talk about uploading video content,

47
00:02:02.03 --> 00:02:04.07
whether you want to
upload single video files

48
00:02:04.07 --> 00:02:07.00
or multiple video files,
as well as some of

49
00:02:07.00 --> 00:02:09.07
the advanced options that
are available if you make it

50
00:02:09.07 --> 00:02:12.04
into certain levels of the
YouTube Partner Program

51
00:02:12.04 --> 00:02:14.06
or you take advantage of Content ID

52
00:02:14.06 --> 00:02:18.03
because you are a major content creator.

53
00:02:18.03 --> 00:02:20.07
We'll also talk about
using Playlists to help

54
00:02:20.07 --> 00:02:23.09
with navigation, making it
easier for people to discover

55
00:02:23.09 --> 00:02:27.02
and watch multiple videos
that are similarly themed.

56
00:02:27.02 --> 00:02:29.04
And I'll walk you through
some of the navigation options

57
00:02:29.04 --> 00:02:31.09
you have to customize your
page to make it easier

58
00:02:31.09 --> 00:02:34.03
for people to browse and find the content

59
00:02:34.03 --> 00:02:36.07
that they're interested in.

60
00:02:36.07 --> 00:02:40.06
We'll explore how you can
use annotations and captions.

61
00:02:40.06 --> 00:02:43.09
Annotations, or cards, allow
you to add interactive links

62
00:02:43.09 --> 00:02:46.05
to a video, and these can be
used for all sorts of things

63
00:02:46.05 --> 00:02:50.00
from selling of products to
taking a survey or a poll.

64
00:02:50.00 --> 00:02:52.04
And we'll explore how captions can be used

65
00:02:52.04 --> 00:02:55.02
to communicate videos
in multiple languages

66
00:02:55.02 --> 00:02:58.09
or to help people who are
hard of hearing or deaf.

67
00:02:58.09 --> 00:03:00.03
I'll also give you some strategies

68
00:03:00.03 --> 00:03:02.03
on building a YouTube community.

69
00:03:02.03 --> 00:03:04.06
A few pieces of practical
advice that I've learned

70
00:03:04.06 --> 00:03:06.09
through the years as well as
how you can take advantage

71
00:03:06.09 --> 00:03:10.00
of built in options inside
the website to make it easier

72
00:03:10.00 --> 00:03:13.01
to connect with your audience.

73
00:03:13.01 --> 00:03:14.08
We'll talk about the Creator Studio,

74
00:03:14.08 --> 00:03:18.00
as well as the new version
that's been in beta development

75
00:03:18.00 --> 00:03:20.09
so you know how to access
it as well as customize it

76
00:03:20.09 --> 00:03:23.06
to get the information
that you need when browsing

77
00:03:23.06 --> 00:03:26.09
and organizing your content.

78
00:03:26.09 --> 00:03:30.00
I'll also share with you some
strategies for live streaming.

79
00:03:30.00 --> 00:03:32.07
Both the simple to use Google Hangouts,

80
00:03:32.07 --> 00:03:34.07
and the more complex option

81
00:03:34.07 --> 00:03:37.00
of setting up your own encoding hardware.

82
00:03:37.00 --> 00:03:38.08
Now we're not going to
go completely in depth

83
00:03:38.08 --> 00:03:41.02
on all things streaming,
but this will get you

84
00:03:41.02 --> 00:03:43.05
up and running.

85
00:03:43.05 --> 00:03:45.02
And we'll talk a bit about signing up

86
00:03:45.02 --> 00:03:47.05
for the YouTube Partner
Program that gives you

87
00:03:47.05 --> 00:03:49.04
additional features on the site

88
00:03:49.04 --> 00:03:52.06
and the option to potentially
monetize your content.

89
00:03:52.06 --> 00:03:54.03
Now, we've got a lot of ground to cover

90
00:03:54.03 --> 00:03:56.09
and there are some areas that overlap.

91
00:03:56.09 --> 00:04:00.00
So I'll frequently introduce
concepts or technology

92
00:04:00.00 --> 00:04:02.07
in one section that effect another.

93
00:04:02.07 --> 00:04:06.06
As such, I would strongly
encourage you to consider watching

94
00:04:06.06 --> 00:04:09.05
this class in the order that I present it.

95
00:04:09.05 --> 00:04:11.03
There's a lot of dependent information

96
00:04:11.03 --> 00:04:12.08
and if you jump around too much,

97
00:04:12.08 --> 00:04:14.09
you may find yourself confused.

98
00:04:14.09 --> 00:04:17.02
Now after you understand the big picture,

99
00:04:17.02 --> 00:04:20.00
feel free to revisit any of
the movies from time to time

100
00:04:20.00 --> 00:04:21.05
when you need to brush up.

101
00:04:21.05 --> 00:04:24.05
And it's not a bad idea to
bookmark the support page

102
00:04:24.05 --> 00:04:27.09
for YouTube because things
do frequently change.

103
00:04:27.09 --> 00:04:30.02
I'm going to bring all of this
to life for you and walk you

104
00:04:30.02 --> 00:04:33.02
through practical advice to
make it as easy as possible

105
00:04:33.02 --> 00:04:36.02
but it is a pretty dense
website with a lot of options,

106
00:04:36.02 --> 00:04:39.02
so be sure to keep a bookmark
saved on your computer

107
00:04:39.02 --> 00:04:41.06
so you can always check
the latest information.

108
00:04:41.06 --> 00:04:43.01
Alright, let's begin.
