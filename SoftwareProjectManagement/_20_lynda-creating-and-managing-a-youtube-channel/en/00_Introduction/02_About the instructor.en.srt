1
00:00:00.05 --> 00:00:02.05
- Before we explore
YouTube, I'd like to take

2
00:00:02.05 --> 00:00:05.00
just a brief moment to introduce myself.

3
00:00:05.00 --> 00:00:07.07
I've been creating web
content for many years.

4
00:00:07.07 --> 00:00:12.03
In fact, I put my first
video up online back in 1996.

5
00:00:12.03 --> 00:00:15.01
So I've been at this for
awhile with encoding video.

6
00:00:15.01 --> 00:00:17.03
I've managed websites for many years,

7
00:00:17.03 --> 00:00:19.06
including those on photography and music

8
00:00:19.06 --> 00:00:21.07
and I've always relied upon different ways

9
00:00:21.07 --> 00:00:24.00
of sharing audio and video content

10
00:00:24.00 --> 00:00:26.05
to really distribute to the masses.

11
00:00:26.05 --> 00:00:28.08
Now, YouTube is a big
part of that strategy

12
00:00:28.08 --> 00:00:30.09
and I'll share with you some
of the lessons I've learned

13
00:00:30.09 --> 00:00:32.02
through the years.

14
00:00:32.02 --> 00:00:34.00
I've also authored about 40 books

15
00:00:34.00 --> 00:00:37.03
for things about photography,
video, and business.

16
00:00:37.03 --> 00:00:39.01
So many of these have been official texts

17
00:00:39.01 --> 00:00:42.08
for Adobe and Apple and a
lot of content on web video.

18
00:00:42.08 --> 00:00:45.09
In fact, I wrote the first
book on video podcasting,

19
00:00:45.09 --> 00:00:48.06
which is a precursor to a lot of things

20
00:00:48.06 --> 00:00:51.06
that have happened now and
migrated over to YouTube.

21
00:00:51.06 --> 00:00:53.04
I'm very familiar with the concept

22
00:00:53.04 --> 00:00:56.00
of creating content for
the web specifically,

23
00:00:56.00 --> 00:00:58.03
and distributing it
out to folks to consume

24
00:00:58.03 --> 00:01:01.01
on a regular basis.

25
00:01:01.01 --> 00:01:04.01
I've recorded more than
150 online classes,

26
00:01:04.01 --> 00:01:06.05
so making online content is something

27
00:01:06.05 --> 00:01:08.00
I'm very familiar with.

28
00:01:08.00 --> 00:01:10.04
And I regularly publish two websites.

29
00:01:10.04 --> 00:01:14.01
A personal blog and a daily
blog about photography

30
00:01:14.01 --> 00:01:16.02
that's been published
with multiple authors

31
00:01:16.02 --> 00:01:19.01
coming up on 20 years now.

32
00:01:19.01 --> 00:01:21.00
I also serve as the
program manager for the

33
00:01:21.00 --> 00:01:22.08
National Association of Broadcasters

34
00:01:22.08 --> 00:01:25.01
for their post-production
world conference.

35
00:01:25.01 --> 00:01:26.09
This is a conference that has been around

36
00:01:26.09 --> 00:01:29.04
for almost two decades and it helps people

37
00:01:29.04 --> 00:01:32.02
learn and master new
skills about video editing,

38
00:01:32.02 --> 00:01:35.09
production, post-production,
and distributing content

39
00:01:35.09 --> 00:01:37.07
to the world.

40
00:01:37.07 --> 00:01:39.08
I also keep myself busy as an owner

41
00:01:39.08 --> 00:01:41.02
of a video production company.

42
00:01:41.02 --> 00:01:43.05
And we're frequently
called upon to make content

43
00:01:43.05 --> 00:01:45.05
for YouTube and to help people with things

44
00:01:45.05 --> 00:01:48.01
like live streaming and live events.

45
00:01:48.01 --> 00:01:50.00
Creating content for the web is something

46
00:01:50.00 --> 00:01:52.03
that I've had the pleasure
of doing a lot of.

47
00:01:52.03 --> 00:01:54.04
As such, I've made a lot of
mistakes through the years

48
00:01:54.04 --> 00:01:57.08
and have had a lot of opportunities
to learn best practices.

49
00:01:57.08 --> 00:01:59.09
We've been able to put this into practice

50
00:01:59.09 --> 00:02:03.01
for many different companies
and brands you might recognize.

51
00:02:03.01 --> 00:02:05.00
A partial client roster includes the fact

52
00:02:05.00 --> 00:02:06.05
that we've done work for companies like

53
00:02:06.05 --> 00:02:15.07
Apple, Adobe, Canon, Cisco, Drobo, Google,

54
00:02:15.07 --> 00:02:22.06
KelbyOne, Lynda.com,
Microsoft, and Skylum Software.

55
00:02:22.06 --> 00:02:25.00
As you can see we've
been around the block.

56
00:02:25.00 --> 00:02:27.01
And as such I have pretty strong opinions

57
00:02:27.01 --> 00:02:29.03
about what works and what doesn't work.

58
00:02:29.03 --> 00:02:31.06
To be perfectly honest
there's things about YouTube

59
00:02:31.06 --> 00:02:32.09
that drive me crazy.

60
00:02:32.09 --> 00:02:34.09
And there are things
about the terms of service

61
00:02:34.09 --> 00:02:37.07
that I want to make sure
you are keenly aware of.

62
00:02:37.07 --> 00:02:39.08
In this course, while
we're going to explore

63
00:02:39.08 --> 00:02:42.03
a lot of technical things, I'm
also going to share with you

64
00:02:42.03 --> 00:02:45.05
practical advice when it
comes to having a strategy,

65
00:02:45.05 --> 00:02:47.03
as well as some business considerations

66
00:02:47.03 --> 00:02:49.00
you need to keep in mind if YouTube

67
00:02:49.00 --> 00:02:51.02
is going to be a part of your platform.

68
00:02:51.02 --> 00:02:52.07
Through the years we've also produced

69
00:02:52.07 --> 00:02:55.03
a lot of different types of content.

70
00:02:55.03 --> 00:02:58.07
We've produced videos on
a wide range of topics

71
00:02:58.07 --> 00:03:00.07
from technology and photography

72
00:03:00.07 --> 00:03:02.09
to graphic design and fashion.

73
00:03:02.09 --> 00:03:04.09
We've worked with a lot of
clients who are producing

74
00:03:04.09 --> 00:03:07.02
content for health and parenting.

75
00:03:07.02 --> 00:03:09.08
As well as even the
college admissions process,

76
00:03:09.08 --> 00:03:14.03
education, fundraising,
fitness, and many other areas.

77
00:03:14.03 --> 00:03:17.01
Now, a lot of you know me
as an on-camera trainer

78
00:03:17.01 --> 00:03:19.05
producing courses like
this one that you watch.

79
00:03:19.05 --> 00:03:21.07
But we spend far more time at my company

80
00:03:21.07 --> 00:03:24.03
helping other people
produce content for the web.

81
00:03:24.03 --> 00:03:26.08
So I'm usually actually behind a camera

82
00:03:26.08 --> 00:03:28.04
and that's going to be some of the lessons

83
00:03:28.04 --> 00:03:29.07
I share with you today.

84
00:03:29.07 --> 00:03:32.03
What have I learned
producing content for YouTube

85
00:03:32.03 --> 00:03:34.06
as well as how to put
the channels together.

86
00:03:34.06 --> 00:03:37.00
We've had the benefit of
managing some YouTube channels

87
00:03:37.00 --> 00:03:38.08
for a few different
brands through the years

88
00:03:38.08 --> 00:03:41.06
and we've learned a lot about
how to make the platform

89
00:03:41.06 --> 00:03:43.02
give us good results.
