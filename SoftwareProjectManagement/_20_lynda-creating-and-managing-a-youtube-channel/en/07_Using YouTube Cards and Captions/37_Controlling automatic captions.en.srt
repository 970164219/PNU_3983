1
00:00:00.05 --> 00:00:01.07
- Captions can be useful

2
00:00:01.07 --> 00:00:04.04
to many different viewers
of YouTube content.

3
00:00:04.04 --> 00:00:07.04
There's a large population
that's hard of hearing or deaf

4
00:00:07.04 --> 00:00:11.02
so making captions available
can be quite useful to them.

5
00:00:11.02 --> 00:00:14.05
Additionally, there are many
places that videos are watched

6
00:00:14.05 --> 00:00:16.04
that it's difficult to hear,

7
00:00:16.04 --> 00:00:19.06
perhaps a busy location with
lots of environmental sound.

8
00:00:19.06 --> 00:00:20.09
You're riding a subway train

9
00:00:20.09 --> 00:00:23.00
and you've got a YouTube video playing,

10
00:00:23.00 --> 00:00:24.07
well it's much more useful

11
00:00:24.07 --> 00:00:26.04
to actually be able to read those titles

12
00:00:26.04 --> 00:00:29.08
than just hear them due to
the environmental noise.

13
00:00:29.08 --> 00:00:32.07
And captions can be loaded
in different languages,

14
00:00:32.07 --> 00:00:35.09
helping people with translations
so they can enjoy content

15
00:00:35.09 --> 00:00:38.07
that wasn't recorded
in their native tongue.

16
00:00:38.07 --> 00:00:41.08
So let's give you some practical
advice on how to use these.

17
00:00:41.08 --> 00:00:44.00
YouTube will automatically create captions

18
00:00:44.00 --> 00:00:46.09
based upon the language of your content.

19
00:00:46.09 --> 00:00:48.08
Now they don't have
this for every language,

20
00:00:48.08 --> 00:00:50.09
but they do for most,

21
00:00:50.09 --> 00:00:53.04
and the automatic captions
are eventually created

22
00:00:53.04 --> 00:00:55.01
depending upon the back load

23
00:00:55.01 --> 00:00:58.03
and how many videos have
been loaded up at a time.

24
00:00:58.03 --> 00:00:59.09
Once the captions are generated,

25
00:00:59.09 --> 00:01:02.09
you can edit them so if
there are spelling mistakes

26
00:01:02.09 --> 00:01:05.03
or proper names that aren't
coming through correctly,

27
00:01:05.03 --> 00:01:07.03
you can fix it.

28
00:01:07.03 --> 00:01:10.07
Do note that the quality
varies from video to video

29
00:01:10.07 --> 00:01:13.04
so you might not want to
rely upon automatic captions

30
00:01:13.04 --> 00:01:16.06
if it's incredibly important
that this is accurate.

31
00:01:16.06 --> 00:01:18.08
Now what I find is that my own voice

32
00:01:18.08 --> 00:01:20.09
is captioned pretty clearly.

33
00:01:20.09 --> 00:01:22.08
That's because I frequently teach

34
00:01:22.08 --> 00:01:26.01
and I'm used to speaking
clearly, deliberately,

35
00:01:26.01 --> 00:01:28.09
and taking pauses from time to time.

36
00:01:28.09 --> 00:01:29.08
Now if I was talking really fast

37
00:01:29.08 --> 00:01:31.08
and just going through things like this,

38
00:01:31.08 --> 00:01:34.02
it might not get all of those things.

39
00:01:34.02 --> 00:01:37.05
So somebody speaking quite
rapidly or with a thick accent

40
00:01:37.05 --> 00:01:39.02
or slurring their words,

41
00:01:39.02 --> 00:01:43.02
well a computer is not as
good at distinguishing sounds

42
00:01:43.02 --> 00:01:44.08
as the human ear,

43
00:01:44.08 --> 00:01:46.07
but it has come a long way

44
00:01:46.07 --> 00:01:48.05
and a lot of the technology used

45
00:01:48.05 --> 00:01:50.06
in mobile phones for speech-to-text

46
00:01:50.06 --> 00:01:53.03
is being employed here on YouTube.

47
00:01:53.03 --> 00:01:54.07
So think of it this way.

48
00:01:54.07 --> 00:01:57.09
Once a video is done, you
can access its captions

49
00:01:57.09 --> 00:02:01.01
and this is pretty easy to edit.

50
00:02:01.01 --> 00:02:04.06
You can see all of the
content on the captions

51
00:02:04.06 --> 00:02:07.00
and where they fall at the video.

52
00:02:07.00 --> 00:02:10.09
If you choose to edit, every
single block becomes fixable

53
00:02:10.09 --> 00:02:14.04
so you can scroll through
and fix any mistakes.

54
00:02:14.04 --> 00:02:16.04
To edit the captions on a video,

55
00:02:16.04 --> 00:02:19.04
simply make sure you're
logged into your account

56
00:02:19.04 --> 00:02:24.04
and then click edit video.

57
00:02:24.04 --> 00:02:31.01
Then switch over to the subtitles
and closed captions tab.

58
00:02:31.01 --> 00:02:34.08
You'll see here if there are
multiple languages available

59
00:02:34.08 --> 00:02:38.00
or if there's only a
single set of captions.

60
00:02:38.00 --> 00:02:41.05
In this case, I haven't
uploaded any additional captions

61
00:02:41.05 --> 00:02:45.01
so only the automatic English
captions have been generated

62
00:02:45.01 --> 00:02:48.02
based upon the language of my video.

63
00:02:48.02 --> 00:02:50.07
If you don't set the language
for a video and upload,

64
00:02:50.07 --> 00:02:55.00
it might not be able to
generate automatic captions.

65
00:02:55.00 --> 00:02:56.00
Now if you need to,

66
00:02:56.00 --> 00:02:59.02
you can load up new subtitles or captions.

67
00:02:59.02 --> 00:03:00.09
For example here we can search

68
00:03:00.09 --> 00:03:05.08
for a particular language
that's supported.

69
00:03:05.08 --> 00:03:08.01
And then if I knew that I needed this,

70
00:03:08.01 --> 00:03:10.07
well I can upload the file

71
00:03:10.07 --> 00:03:14.02
or I can go in and start
to create this by hand

72
00:03:14.02 --> 00:03:16.09
and simply type what's being said.

73
00:03:16.09 --> 00:03:18.05
Albeit that's a bit slow,

74
00:03:18.05 --> 00:03:21.06
but there is no auto
captioning for Chinese here.

75
00:03:21.06 --> 00:03:23.07
This would be more of
a method of putting up

76
00:03:23.07 --> 00:03:25.08
a translation set of captions

77
00:03:25.08 --> 00:03:28.06
and that's the sort of thing
that either a colleague,

78
00:03:28.06 --> 00:03:32.04
a community member or a
paid service can provide.

79
00:03:32.04 --> 00:03:34.08
Now let's go backwards here

80
00:03:34.08 --> 00:03:36.03
and you'll see that in this case,

81
00:03:36.03 --> 00:03:38.06
there are the English captions.

82
00:03:38.06 --> 00:03:39.06
If I click on that,

83
00:03:39.06 --> 00:03:42.08
I can see what's been
automatically generated.

84
00:03:42.08 --> 00:03:44.09
And as the video plays,

85
00:03:44.09 --> 00:03:46.06
you see they're available right below

86
00:03:46.06 --> 00:03:50.02
with scrolling timelines
and the audio waveform.

87
00:03:50.02 --> 00:03:52.07
You can watch what's happening there.

88
00:03:52.07 --> 00:03:54.06
Now if I pause this,

89
00:03:54.06 --> 00:03:58.06
I see for example that
it's referring to accent AI

90
00:03:58.06 --> 00:04:00.06
and this needs to be a proper noun

91
00:04:00.06 --> 00:04:02.07
because it's the name of a filter.

92
00:04:02.07 --> 00:04:05.02
So I'm going to choose to edit this here

93
00:04:05.02 --> 00:04:07.03
and I have the ability to download it

94
00:04:07.03 --> 00:04:09.09
if I want to take it into a text editor.

95
00:04:09.09 --> 00:04:12.09
So if you need to, you can
actually download these captions

96
00:04:12.09 --> 00:04:16.08
to use on other services
or download the file,

97
00:04:16.08 --> 00:04:20.00
open it up in a text editor
and make a global change,

98
00:04:20.00 --> 00:04:21.08
and then reupload it.

99
00:04:21.08 --> 00:04:25.04
That's a very simple way
to actually do bulk edits.

100
00:04:25.04 --> 00:04:27.05
Or if you just need to do a quick fix,

101
00:04:27.05 --> 00:04:30.05
you can click edit to fix it right here

102
00:04:30.05 --> 00:04:32.06
in the YouTube browser.

103
00:04:32.06 --> 00:04:36.07
So in this case I'll just do a search

104
00:04:36.07 --> 00:04:40.06
and type in the word accent
and you see it found it.

105
00:04:40.06 --> 00:04:45.04
So I'll change that to a capital A

106
00:04:45.04 --> 00:04:48.05
and it made the change.

107
00:04:48.05 --> 00:04:53.05
There's three more matches.

108
00:04:53.05 --> 00:04:59.06
Let's go ahead here and search.

109
00:04:59.06 --> 00:05:03.00
Yup and that's all
instances on the screen.

110
00:05:03.00 --> 00:05:07.03
Now let's do a search for the word Luminar

111
00:05:07.03 --> 00:05:09.06
and it looks like it
found it there correctly,

112
00:05:09.06 --> 00:05:13.07
but not necessarily in
the application itself.

113
00:05:13.07 --> 00:05:15.05
So as we scroll through,

114
00:05:15.05 --> 00:05:18.03
I can take a look and see
if there's any challenges

115
00:05:18.03 --> 00:05:23.00
in the application with proper
names not being recognized.

116
00:05:23.00 --> 00:05:24.06
Notice here it's pretty simple.

117
00:05:24.06 --> 00:05:26.08
All of these controls are spelled out

118
00:05:26.08 --> 00:05:29.01
and you can see the
captions that are being used

119
00:05:29.01 --> 00:05:30.08
in the video itself.

120
00:05:30.08 --> 00:05:33.00
If you find that if you
need to make a change,

121
00:05:33.00 --> 00:05:34.01
that's simple enough.

122
00:05:34.01 --> 00:05:36.09
Just click on the caption
itself and edit it.

123
00:05:36.09 --> 00:05:41.04
This is a useful way to make
small changes for minor fixes.

124
00:05:41.04 --> 00:05:43.00
If there are global changes,

125
00:05:43.00 --> 00:05:45.04
just be sure to download the file

126
00:05:45.04 --> 00:05:47.04
and you can actually make changes

127
00:05:47.04 --> 00:05:50.01
and then upload it back to replace.

128
00:05:50.01 --> 00:05:51.07
Now to make editing easier,

129
00:05:51.07 --> 00:05:53.05
there are a series of keyboard shortcuts

130
00:05:53.05 --> 00:05:55.08
if you're going to be
editing captions a lot.

131
00:05:55.08 --> 00:05:57.05
I'm not going to walk
through all of these,

132
00:05:57.05 --> 00:06:00.08
but as you see by using some
of the keyboard shortcuts

133
00:06:00.08 --> 00:06:02.07
of left and right arrows

134
00:06:02.07 --> 00:06:05.08
or the ability to use
the spacebar or enter,

135
00:06:05.08 --> 00:06:09.02
this is going to make it
easy to actually make edits.

136
00:06:09.02 --> 00:06:13.02
So you can very quickly jump
from forward and back in time,

137
00:06:13.02 --> 00:06:15.02
go from one caption to the next

138
00:06:15.02 --> 00:06:17.09
and easily make edits of those captions

139
00:06:17.09 --> 00:06:20.01
and then add them into the timeline.

140
00:06:20.01 --> 00:06:21.09
This could be quite useful.

141
00:06:21.09 --> 00:06:25.03
Now besides using the built-in
auto generated captions,

142
00:06:25.03 --> 00:06:28.02
you can of course upload
captions of your choice

143
00:06:28.02 --> 00:06:30.00
and let's talk about that next.
