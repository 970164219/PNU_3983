1
00:00:00.05 --> 00:00:03.00
- If your content has been
professionally captioned

2
00:00:03.00 --> 00:00:06.00
by an outside vendor, you can upload that.

3
00:00:06.00 --> 00:00:08.06
There's also great
tools like Transcriptive

4
00:00:08.06 --> 00:00:11.07
from Digital Anarchy, that
makes it easy to submit your

5
00:00:11.07 --> 00:00:14.04
video editing project to an online service

6
00:00:14.04 --> 00:00:17.02
and use computer intelligence
to get it captioned.

7
00:00:17.02 --> 00:00:19.09
And of course there are
numerous captioning companies

8
00:00:19.09 --> 00:00:23.00
out there that will use
live people to go through

9
00:00:23.00 --> 00:00:24.04
and caption the video.

10
00:00:24.04 --> 00:00:26.05
So there are many ways to solve this,

11
00:00:26.05 --> 00:00:28.06
and in fact we do have
some additional training

12
00:00:28.06 --> 00:00:30.05
in the online library.

13
00:00:30.05 --> 00:00:33.07
The important thing here is
that YouTube makes it easy

14
00:00:33.07 --> 00:00:36.00
for you to upload captions.

15
00:00:36.00 --> 00:00:37.08
So, if you have captions for your content,

16
00:00:37.08 --> 00:00:40.04
whether those be the native
language or a translation,

17
00:00:40.04 --> 00:00:41.06
it's pretty simple.

18
00:00:41.06 --> 00:00:44.05
Make sure that your videos are accessible

19
00:00:44.05 --> 00:00:46.05
because of the captioning track.

20
00:00:46.05 --> 00:00:49.04
This means that people who
have different challenges

21
00:00:49.04 --> 00:00:52.00
in consuming the content will
have an easier time with it,

22
00:00:52.00 --> 00:00:55.02
and it may even be a legal
requirement depending upon

23
00:00:55.02 --> 00:00:56.08
the country you're working in.

24
00:00:56.08 --> 00:00:59.07
You can have multiple
caption tracks as well.

25
00:00:59.07 --> 00:01:03.07
In different languages or dialects.

26
00:01:03.07 --> 00:01:07.01
What it comes down to
is it's pretty simple.

27
00:01:07.01 --> 00:01:09.03
You're going to go into the video manager

28
00:01:09.03 --> 00:01:12.01
and select and individual
video, then edit it.

29
00:01:12.01 --> 00:01:16.05
Once there, choose the subtitles
and closed captions tab,

30
00:01:16.05 --> 00:01:19.07
and you click the add button to add more.

31
00:01:19.07 --> 00:01:21.06
Let me show you this one more time.

32
00:01:21.06 --> 00:01:23.06
From the video manager.

33
00:01:23.06 --> 00:01:28.01
I'll simply click edit to open up a video,

34
00:01:28.01 --> 00:01:35.04
and then go to the subtitles
and closed captions tab.

35
00:01:35.04 --> 00:01:38.01
This will show me any existing captions.

36
00:01:38.01 --> 00:01:41.02
Remember, you can click on
this to edit the automatic ones

37
00:01:41.02 --> 00:01:44.06
or click the add button to add more.

38
00:01:44.06 --> 00:01:49.08
This'll make it easy for
you to upload content.

39
00:01:49.08 --> 00:01:54.03
You'll see here for example,
we can choose to upload a file.

40
00:01:54.03 --> 00:01:57.04
We can have it do the transcriptions

41
00:01:57.04 --> 00:01:59.07
This is generally automatically done,

42
00:01:59.07 --> 00:02:02.02
but if for some reason
it hasn't been done yet,

43
00:02:02.02 --> 00:02:04.03
or you didn't specify a language,

44
00:02:04.03 --> 00:02:07.04
you can tell it to
transcribe and auto-sync,

45
00:02:07.04 --> 00:02:10.09
or you can create your own from scratch.

46
00:02:10.09 --> 00:02:13.03
And clicking this will
take you into the editor,

47
00:02:13.03 --> 00:02:15.02
but for the most part it's a simple

48
00:02:15.02 --> 00:02:17.02
as choosing to upload a file.

49
00:02:17.02 --> 00:02:20.04
Once you've done this, you
have the ability to upload

50
00:02:20.04 --> 00:02:22.03
one of two types.

51
00:02:22.03 --> 00:02:24.09
You can go ahead and put a transcript in

52
00:02:24.09 --> 00:02:26.09
or a subtitles file.

53
00:02:26.09 --> 00:02:29.04
And the difference here is pretty subtle.

54
00:02:29.04 --> 00:02:33.02
The transcript is going to be
what's being said on screen,

55
00:02:33.02 --> 00:02:36.05
while subtitles are generally
a different language.

56
00:02:36.05 --> 00:02:39.04
Subtitles can also be chosen to be left up

57
00:02:39.04 --> 00:02:42.04
while transcriptions are usually going to

58
00:02:42.04 --> 00:02:44.04
go ahead and roll on.

59
00:02:44.04 --> 00:02:46.03
If you click learn more, you'll learn

60
00:02:46.03 --> 00:02:49.00
about the many different
formats that are available

61
00:02:49.00 --> 00:02:50.09
and here you can decide if you wanted

62
00:02:50.09 --> 00:02:53.00
to use closed captions or subtitles,

63
00:02:53.00 --> 00:02:55.01
as well as find out what type of

64
00:02:55.01 --> 00:02:57.03
file formats are going to work.

65
00:02:57.03 --> 00:02:59.03
There are many different
programs out there

66
00:02:59.03 --> 00:03:02.02
for subtitling and transcript
as this is technology

67
00:03:02.02 --> 00:03:05.03
that's been used on things
like DVDs and Blu-Rays

68
00:03:05.03 --> 00:03:06.09
as well as broadcast television.
