1
00:00:00.05 --> 00:00:01.09
- Earlier in the course, we talked

2
00:00:01.09 --> 00:00:04.03
about the limitations on replacing a movie

3
00:00:04.03 --> 00:00:06.09
and I mentioned cards or annotations.

4
00:00:06.09 --> 00:00:09.00
Even if you're not looking
to replace a movie,

5
00:00:09.00 --> 00:00:11.00
cards and annotations give a great way

6
00:00:11.00 --> 00:00:14.01
to add interactivity
to your YouTube content

7
00:00:14.01 --> 00:00:15.08
and use it as a lead generator

8
00:00:15.08 --> 00:00:19.09
or to give people additional
ways that they can interact.

9
00:00:19.09 --> 00:00:21.06
What exactly is a card?

10
00:00:21.06 --> 00:00:24.05
Well, cards are
pre-formatted notifications

11
00:00:24.05 --> 00:00:26.06
that appear on desktop and mobile

12
00:00:26.06 --> 00:00:28.07
and they can popup over your video.

13
00:00:28.07 --> 00:00:30.06
They can be used to promote a brand

14
00:00:30.06 --> 00:00:34.02
or other videos that you
have on your channel.

15
00:00:34.02 --> 00:00:37.01
Once they're set up, a
small rectangular box,

16
00:00:37.01 --> 00:00:40.00
or a teaser, will appear
in the top right corner

17
00:00:40.00 --> 00:00:42.05
of the video.

18
00:00:42.05 --> 00:00:45.02
If the viewers click on
this, well, then the card

19
00:00:45.02 --> 00:00:47.03
will actually trigger an interaction

20
00:00:47.03 --> 00:00:50.07
and content can load to the
side of the video or below it,

21
00:00:50.07 --> 00:00:54.01
depending upon where you're accessing it.

22
00:00:54.01 --> 00:00:56.09
Now you might be wondering
how could you use these links?

23
00:00:56.09 --> 00:00:58.08
Well, these cards can actually serve

24
00:00:58.08 --> 00:01:00.08
several different purposes.

25
00:01:00.08 --> 00:01:03.02
First up, a lot of folks
will use it to link

26
00:01:03.02 --> 00:01:05.07
to an individual video or a playlist.

27
00:01:05.07 --> 00:01:07.01
Maybe this is a newer version

28
00:01:07.01 --> 00:01:10.05
of the video or related content.

29
00:01:10.05 --> 00:01:13.07
Also, you can link back to
your individual channel,

30
00:01:13.07 --> 00:01:15.07
promoting your channel or another channel

31
00:01:15.07 --> 00:01:19.07
where people can get a lot more
content similar to this one.

32
00:01:19.07 --> 00:01:22.09
You can use it as a call for donations.

33
00:01:22.09 --> 00:01:26.00
This allows you to feature
a nonprofit of your choice

34
00:01:26.00 --> 00:01:29.05
or if you are a nonprofit
and YouTube recognizes you,

35
00:01:29.05 --> 00:01:32.04
then you can link to yourself.

36
00:01:32.04 --> 00:01:34.05
You can have a poll where people can vote

37
00:01:34.05 --> 00:01:36.04
or engage in the content,

38
00:01:36.04 --> 00:01:38.02
maybe commenting on what type of videos

39
00:01:38.02 --> 00:01:40.09
they'd like you to record next.

40
00:01:40.09 --> 00:01:43.09
And you can link to a
pre-approved website.

41
00:01:43.09 --> 00:01:47.05
Generally speaking, you will
be limited to one website

42
00:01:47.05 --> 00:01:49.09
so you'll have to affiliate a website

43
00:01:49.09 --> 00:01:52.04
with your YouTube channel
under the brand account

44
00:01:52.04 --> 00:01:55.01
and then you might have to
actually do something to prove

45
00:01:55.01 --> 00:01:57.05
that that's the official website.

46
00:01:57.05 --> 00:01:58.06
Usually it's pretty simple.

47
00:01:58.06 --> 00:02:00.03
Sometimes they'll give you a code to embed

48
00:02:00.03 --> 00:02:02.06
or they may see that you've connected

49
00:02:02.06 --> 00:02:04.02
an authorized social media account

50
00:02:04.02 --> 00:02:07.04
but you are going to need
to validate that website.

51
00:02:07.04 --> 00:02:09.01
Once you've done this, the user interface

52
00:02:09.01 --> 00:02:10.02
is pretty straight forward

53
00:02:10.02 --> 00:02:14.04
and it allows you to add
a card for interactivity.

54
00:02:14.04 --> 00:02:16.05
Then, that card can contain a link

55
00:02:16.05 --> 00:02:21.08
and a call to action as well as a graphic.

56
00:02:21.08 --> 00:02:23.09
Then, when the video is playing,

57
00:02:23.09 --> 00:02:25.04
this will have an overlay.

58
00:02:25.04 --> 00:02:26.09
Now, it might be closed initially,

59
00:02:26.09 --> 00:02:30.04
but with a click, it
can open up and reveal.

60
00:02:30.04 --> 00:02:32.00
Let me show you how this works.

61
00:02:32.00 --> 00:02:35.09
I'll go to creator studio and
then go to my video manager.

62
00:02:35.09 --> 00:02:38.01
Now it's just a matter of finding a video

63
00:02:38.01 --> 00:02:40.04
that I want to tag.

64
00:02:40.04 --> 00:02:45.09
Let's go ahead here and edit
this first one on Luminar.

65
00:02:45.09 --> 00:02:49.06
Now, I'll just switch
over to the cards screen.

66
00:02:49.06 --> 00:02:53.01
It's the fifth tab in.

67
00:02:53.01 --> 00:02:56.08
And you'll see a simple editor.

68
00:02:56.08 --> 00:03:00.08
Now as the video plays, the
timeline will move down below

69
00:03:00.08 --> 00:03:04.04
and cards can be placed at
specific points in time.

70
00:03:04.04 --> 00:03:07.05
Let's go ahead and add a card here

71
00:03:07.05 --> 00:03:12.04
and put a link in.

72
00:03:12.04 --> 00:03:14.08
Now it asks me where I want to link.

73
00:03:14.08 --> 00:03:17.03
Now, I can choose from other websites

74
00:03:17.03 --> 00:03:19.05
that have been affiliated and validated

75
00:03:19.05 --> 00:03:22.04
or I can link to particular
merchandise sites

76
00:03:22.04 --> 00:03:26.02
or crowdfunding sites if I'm
using this for fundraising.

77
00:03:26.02 --> 00:03:28.02
You'll see, for example,
if you click on these,

78
00:03:28.02 --> 00:03:30.05
it gives you a list of all
of the different websites

79
00:03:30.05 --> 00:03:32.05
that YouTube has approved

80
00:03:32.05 --> 00:03:35.03
for either merchandise or crowdfunding.

81
00:03:35.03 --> 00:03:37.06
And there's quite a few.

82
00:03:37.06 --> 00:03:41.01
Now, I'm going to go ahead
and enter a specific link here

83
00:03:41.01 --> 00:03:42.09
so I'll choose photo focus,

84
00:03:42.09 --> 00:03:45.07
but you'll see the link
URL is pre-populated.

85
00:03:45.07 --> 00:03:48.02
I can also customize that.

86
00:03:48.02 --> 00:03:50.08
So, if I have a particular
article on Photo Focus

87
00:03:50.08 --> 00:03:53.08
that I want to link
people to, I can do that.

88
00:03:53.08 --> 00:03:57.01
Let's go and visit photofocus.com

89
00:03:57.01 --> 00:04:01.09
and I'll do a search for Luminar.

90
00:04:01.09 --> 00:04:04.05
And maybe I want to link to
this particular article here

91
00:04:04.05 --> 00:04:06.08
to get free presets.

92
00:04:06.08 --> 00:04:11.00
So I'll just right
click and copy the link.

93
00:04:11.00 --> 00:04:14.07
Now, back in YouTube, what
I can do is say let's link

94
00:04:14.07 --> 00:04:17.04
to that specific URL

95
00:04:17.04 --> 00:04:18.07
and I'll click next.

96
00:04:18.07 --> 00:04:20.06
It's going to validate that URL

97
00:04:20.06 --> 00:04:23.05
and should show me some more
information in a moment.

98
00:04:23.05 --> 00:04:33.05
I'll label this here.

99
00:04:33.05 --> 00:04:36.02
Now, you'll notice that
there's a limit here

100
00:04:36.02 --> 00:04:42.01
so let's shorten this
and I'll add teaser text.

101
00:04:42.01 --> 00:04:46.09
You'll notice there is a
limit on the character count.

102
00:04:46.09 --> 00:04:50.03
And I can click to change the image.

103
00:04:50.03 --> 00:04:52.02
Now, it needs to be a square.

104
00:04:52.02 --> 00:04:55.09
And let's just navigate
to a .png file here,

105
00:04:55.09 --> 00:04:59.04
in this case, the application icon.

106
00:04:59.04 --> 00:05:02.08
So I've got the URL, I've
got a title for the card

107
00:05:02.08 --> 00:05:06.01
and a little bit of a call to
action and some teaser text.

108
00:05:06.01 --> 00:05:09.07
So I can click create card.

109
00:05:09.07 --> 00:05:12.08
And you'll see that
it's added to the list.

110
00:05:12.08 --> 00:05:15.07
Now, it's currently set
to come in at six seconds

111
00:05:15.07 --> 00:05:20.03
'cause that's were I put this
but that can be easily moved.

112
00:05:20.03 --> 00:05:23.01
Just grab it and position it in time

113
00:05:23.01 --> 00:05:25.09
where you want it to appear.

114
00:05:25.09 --> 00:05:29.08
Now, once it hits that point
the information will pop up

115
00:05:29.08 --> 00:05:32.02
and it will display.

116
00:05:32.02 --> 00:05:33.05
There we go.

117
00:05:33.05 --> 00:05:35.09
Now if I wanted to, I
could add additional cards

118
00:05:35.09 --> 00:05:38.04
for interactivity, such as a poll.

119
00:05:38.04 --> 00:05:41.02
If I create here, you see I
can actually add a question

120
00:05:41.02 --> 00:05:44.00
and give people choices
so they can answer it.

121
00:05:44.00 --> 00:05:47.07
Works very well, allowing here
for a multiple choice poll.

122
00:05:47.07 --> 00:05:49.01
Let's click cancel though.

123
00:05:49.01 --> 00:05:51.06
And in this case, all the
changes have been saved

124
00:05:51.06 --> 00:05:55.05
so I'm just going to go ahead
and take a look at that video.

125
00:05:55.05 --> 00:05:58.05
Let's go back here

126
00:05:58.05 --> 00:06:00.01
and we'll visit that video

127
00:06:00.01 --> 00:06:06.00
and take a look at it full screen.

128
00:06:06.00 --> 00:06:10.03
And around 19 seconds or so,

129
00:06:10.03 --> 00:06:15.07
that ad's going to pop up.

130
00:06:15.07 --> 00:06:17.03
You see the call to action there.

131
00:06:17.03 --> 00:06:20.02
Get 15 free Luminar Presets.

132
00:06:20.02 --> 00:06:21.08
Oh, that's interesting.

133
00:06:21.08 --> 00:06:24.07
And if I don't take
action, it just disappears,

134
00:06:24.07 --> 00:06:27.05
not interfering with
the viewer's enjoyment.

135
00:06:27.05 --> 00:06:29.01
But if that does catch their eye

136
00:06:29.01 --> 00:06:31.07
and it pops back on screen here,

137
00:06:31.07 --> 00:06:34.04
if I mouse over it here and click,

138
00:06:34.04 --> 00:06:36.08
you see that is shows me a great little ad

139
00:06:36.08 --> 00:06:38.03
telling me what's possible.

140
00:06:38.03 --> 00:06:41.04
So now with a click, it's
going to trigger a visit

141
00:06:41.04 --> 00:06:44.06
to that webpage and as you see,

142
00:06:44.06 --> 00:06:48.00
I pulled somebody from
YouTube back to my website

143
00:06:48.00 --> 00:06:51.01
where they can engage
and download free presets

144
00:06:51.01 --> 00:06:52.09
and I can use this as a method

145
00:06:52.09 --> 00:06:56.00
to actually capture their email as a lead.

146
00:06:56.00 --> 00:06:58.08
The use of cards are a really good idea

147
00:06:58.08 --> 00:07:00.03
and it's something that I, myself,

148
00:07:00.03 --> 00:07:02.02
need to take better advantage of.

149
00:07:02.02 --> 00:07:05.04
YouTube frequently pulls
people from your website

150
00:07:05.04 --> 00:07:07.06
or other websites back to YouTube

151
00:07:07.06 --> 00:07:09.05
but this is YouTube giving back,

152
00:07:09.05 --> 00:07:11.08
allowing you to take your own content

153
00:07:11.08 --> 00:07:14.06
and drive people to a crowdfunding site

154
00:07:14.06 --> 00:07:18.03
or to a merchandise site or
to your own validated website

155
00:07:18.03 --> 00:07:21.07
and I highly recommend you
take advantage of this.

156
00:07:21.07 --> 00:07:24.01
If you're looking for some best practices,

157
00:07:24.01 --> 00:07:26.03
remember, that cards will work best

158
00:07:26.03 --> 00:07:28.06
when there's a scripted call to action

159
00:07:28.06 --> 00:07:31.00
or it's highly relevant.

160
00:07:31.00 --> 00:07:32.09
So, in the case of those presets,

161
00:07:32.09 --> 00:07:35.01
if I used a preset in the video

162
00:07:35.01 --> 00:07:37.07
and then say, "oh, if you'd
like to download the presets,

163
00:07:37.07 --> 00:07:39.08
"just click the link on the screen,"

164
00:07:39.08 --> 00:07:43.01
people would notice that.

165
00:07:43.01 --> 00:07:45.05
Do keep in mind that
cards are quite convenient

166
00:07:45.05 --> 00:07:48.02
because they give the
viewer the option to click

167
00:07:48.02 --> 00:07:50.07
and if they don't click,
it simply disappears

168
00:07:50.07 --> 00:07:52.01
and doesn't annoy them.

169
00:07:52.01 --> 00:07:53.08
Now, you can of course put links

170
00:07:53.08 --> 00:07:55.09
into the bottom of the
video's description,

171
00:07:55.09 --> 00:07:58.07
but this is right there
on the content itself

172
00:07:58.07 --> 00:08:00.05
and if someone is watching full screen

173
00:08:00.05 --> 00:08:03.04
or on a device that is
really just taking them

174
00:08:03.04 --> 00:08:04.06
into the content,

175
00:08:04.06 --> 00:08:06.03
this will make it that much easier

176
00:08:06.03 --> 00:08:07.08
to click and visit.
