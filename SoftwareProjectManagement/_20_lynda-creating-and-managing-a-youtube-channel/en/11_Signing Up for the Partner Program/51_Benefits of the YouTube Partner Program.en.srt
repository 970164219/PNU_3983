1
00:00:00.05 --> 00:00:02.08
- You've heard me mention
the YouTube Partner Program

2
00:00:02.08 --> 00:00:04.00
a few times.

3
00:00:04.00 --> 00:00:07.05
This is a program that unlocks
additional opportunities

4
00:00:07.05 --> 00:00:09.06
including monetization.

5
00:00:09.06 --> 00:00:13.02
Let me give a few pieces of
information that are useful,

6
00:00:13.02 --> 00:00:15.04
but do keep in mind
that the Partner Program

7
00:00:15.04 --> 00:00:18.06
is an evolving program
whose requirements change.

8
00:00:18.06 --> 00:00:21.09
First up, what are the benefits
of the Partner Program?

9
00:00:21.09 --> 00:00:24.01
Well, by signing up for
the Partner Program,

10
00:00:24.01 --> 00:00:26.02
this is first and foremost
going to allow you

11
00:00:26.02 --> 00:00:28.03
to monetize your content.

12
00:00:28.03 --> 00:00:30.03
This means that you can take advantage

13
00:00:30.03 --> 00:00:33.00
of serving up ads on your content,

14
00:00:33.00 --> 00:00:34.09
ads that YouTube provides,

15
00:00:34.09 --> 00:00:37.01
paid subscriptions to your content,

16
00:00:37.01 --> 00:00:40.02
and the ability to offer
merchandise for sale

17
00:00:40.02 --> 00:00:43.08
through YouTube or a third party provider.

18
00:00:43.08 --> 00:00:46.02
YouTube Partner Videos can also earn money

19
00:00:46.02 --> 00:00:48.03
from those ads or fees.

20
00:00:48.03 --> 00:00:51.00
This includes if the content
is featured on things

21
00:00:51.00 --> 00:00:53.06
like YouTube Television or YouTube Red

22
00:00:53.06 --> 00:00:57.08
where people are paying for premium access

23
00:00:57.08 --> 00:01:00.04
and it will allow you to reach more people

24
00:01:00.04 --> 00:01:02.05
as the Partner Program content

25
00:01:02.05 --> 00:01:06.07
tends to get more favorable treatment.

26
00:01:06.07 --> 00:01:08.06
It is a non-exclusive agreement,

27
00:01:08.06 --> 00:01:10.08
meaning that you are
allowed to put the content

28
00:01:10.08 --> 00:01:14.01
onto other platforms not just YouTube.

29
00:01:14.01 --> 00:01:17.00
In order to become a
partner, it's pretty simple.

30
00:01:17.00 --> 00:01:20.05
First, make sure your YouTube
account is in good standing

31
00:01:20.05 --> 00:01:22.09
with no complaints from
community guidelines

32
00:01:22.09 --> 00:01:25.08
or copyright infringement.

33
00:01:25.08 --> 00:01:27.08
You want to make sure that
the content you're uploading

34
00:01:27.08 --> 00:01:30.03
is considered advertiser-friendly,

35
00:01:30.03 --> 00:01:31.08
that it's original content,

36
00:01:31.08 --> 00:01:34.02
not just content that
you're taking from others

37
00:01:34.02 --> 00:01:36.02
or that you don't have the rights to.

38
00:01:36.02 --> 00:01:40.01
It is critical that you are
not a copyright infringer.

39
00:01:40.01 --> 00:01:42.04
YouTube has really cracked down on people

40
00:01:42.04 --> 00:01:45.00
uploading videos that they
don't have the rights to

41
00:01:45.00 --> 00:01:48.04
just to get views to try to
make money off of YouTube ads.

42
00:01:48.04 --> 00:01:50.08
In fact, they are making lots of changes

43
00:01:50.08 --> 00:01:53.03
to make this even more difficult lately.

44
00:01:53.03 --> 00:01:56.06
Now very recently in 2018,

45
00:01:56.06 --> 00:02:00.03
YouTube made some significant
changes to the Partner Program

46
00:02:00.03 --> 00:02:03.07
that took a lot of people who
are in it and kicked them out.

47
00:02:03.07 --> 00:02:05.09
I had some channels that were kicked out

48
00:02:05.09 --> 00:02:08.04
because they didn't have
enough subscribers or views

49
00:02:08.04 --> 00:02:10.08
and I had other channels
that were not affected.

50
00:02:10.08 --> 00:02:13.02
What it means is that it used to be that

51
00:02:13.02 --> 00:02:15.01
anybody can join the Partner Program

52
00:02:15.01 --> 00:02:17.01
and start to monetize their content,

53
00:02:17.01 --> 00:02:20.02
but now YouTube has set
certain threshold levels

54
00:02:20.02 --> 00:02:22.00
for a channel or brand account.

55
00:02:22.00 --> 00:02:23.07
This doesn't affect a lot of features

56
00:02:23.07 --> 00:02:26.08
that used to be Partner only.

57
00:02:26.08 --> 00:02:29.06
For example, you still can use cards now

58
00:02:29.06 --> 00:02:31.07
without being a YouTube Partner

59
00:02:31.07 --> 00:02:35.09
and you have access to
Creator Studio, custom URLs,

60
00:02:35.09 --> 00:02:37.08
and custom thumbnails.

61
00:02:37.08 --> 00:02:41.00
All of these used to be
requirements of being a member

62
00:02:41.00 --> 00:02:42.04
in the Partner Program,

63
00:02:42.04 --> 00:02:45.04
but YouTube decided to make
those available to everyone

64
00:02:45.04 --> 00:02:48.08
even if they're not in
the Partner Program.

65
00:02:48.08 --> 00:02:50.06
You can still use end screens

66
00:02:50.06 --> 00:02:52.06
which allow you to put multiple videos up

67
00:02:52.06 --> 00:02:56.07
at the end of your video telling
people what to watch next

68
00:02:56.07 --> 00:02:58.09
and live streaming which is a great way

69
00:02:58.09 --> 00:03:01.08
to engage with folks.

70
00:03:01.08 --> 00:03:04.06
You also can do scheduled videos.

71
00:03:04.06 --> 00:03:06.06
All of these were
features that used to mean

72
00:03:06.06 --> 00:03:08.06
that you had to be a YouTube Partner.

73
00:03:08.06 --> 00:03:10.09
So it used to be that if you wanted

74
00:03:10.09 --> 00:03:12.06
any of these advanced options,

75
00:03:12.06 --> 00:03:14.07
you had to join their program.

76
00:03:14.07 --> 00:03:18.00
And I used to tell folks join
the YouTube Partner Program

77
00:03:18.00 --> 00:03:19.09
and then feel free to turn off ads

78
00:03:19.09 --> 00:03:21.06
if you don't want to use them.

79
00:03:21.06 --> 00:03:23.09
I often find that serving up ads

80
00:03:23.09 --> 00:03:26.05
isn't worth the annoyance to my customers

81
00:03:26.05 --> 00:03:29.02
versus what I got from the other benefits

82
00:03:29.02 --> 00:03:30.09
of reaching more people.

83
00:03:30.09 --> 00:03:33.08
But that's ultimately up to you.

84
00:03:33.08 --> 00:03:35.09
Another feature that's also available

85
00:03:35.09 --> 00:03:39.02
that used to be tied to the
Partner Program is analytics.

86
00:03:39.02 --> 00:03:41.09
So you can still see great statistics now

87
00:03:41.09 --> 00:03:45.02
without joining the Partner Program.

88
00:03:45.02 --> 00:03:47.00
But there are a couple of features

89
00:03:47.00 --> 00:03:50.09
that do require a YouTube
Partner Program membership.

90
00:03:50.09 --> 00:03:53.00
Super Chat, which is the ability

91
00:03:53.00 --> 00:03:55.09
to have monetized chats on live stream,

92
00:03:55.09 --> 00:03:59.06
requires you to be a member
of the Partner Program.

93
00:03:59.06 --> 00:04:02.01
This will allow people
to purchase chat messages

94
00:04:02.01 --> 00:04:03.06
during your live streams

95
00:04:03.06 --> 00:04:06.02
and is particularly
popular with celebrities

96
00:04:06.02 --> 00:04:08.03
and gaming channels.

97
00:04:08.03 --> 00:04:11.03
The Super Chat ends up
highlighted by a color

98
00:04:11.03 --> 00:04:14.04
and it can be pinned for
a certain period of time

99
00:04:14.04 --> 00:04:17.07
based upon what someone is willing to pay.

100
00:04:17.07 --> 00:04:20.03
Sponsorships, which
are also only available

101
00:04:20.03 --> 00:04:21.05
for gaming channels,

102
00:04:21.05 --> 00:04:24.01
require you to be a member
of the Partner Program.

103
00:04:24.01 --> 00:04:26.07
This allows people to sponsor you

104
00:04:26.07 --> 00:04:30.01
for in this case playing games
and people watch and enjoy.

105
00:04:30.01 --> 00:04:31.04
Now personally,

106
00:04:31.04 --> 00:04:33.07
I don't understand the
concept of sponsorships

107
00:04:33.07 --> 00:04:36.01
of paying somebody else
to play video games.

108
00:04:36.01 --> 00:04:39.00
I'd much rather buy the
games and play them myself,

109
00:04:39.00 --> 00:04:42.07
but different types of
entertainment for different people.

110
00:04:42.07 --> 00:04:45.01
So while some folks enjoy watching sports,

111
00:04:45.01 --> 00:04:47.01
other folks enjoy watching video games

112
00:04:47.01 --> 00:04:49.07
and they're willing to
pay for a ticket to do so.

113
00:04:49.07 --> 00:04:52.01
So while it might seem
a little strange to me,

114
00:04:52.01 --> 00:04:53.05
it makes about as much sense

115
00:04:53.05 --> 00:04:55.08
as paying someone to go
watch a baseball game

116
00:04:55.08 --> 00:04:57.06
so if there's an audience,

117
00:04:57.06 --> 00:04:59.03
someone will charge money for it.

118
00:04:59.03 --> 00:05:00.03
There are some benefits

119
00:05:00.03 --> 00:05:03.01
for different levels
of the Creator program.

120
00:05:03.01 --> 00:05:06.08
So this breaks down to
basically these categories.

121
00:05:06.08 --> 00:05:08.01
So if you're just getting started,

122
00:05:08.01 --> 00:05:10.00
you're in the Graphite category.

123
00:05:10.00 --> 00:05:12.00
Most folks after they've
built up an audience

124
00:05:12.00 --> 00:05:13.06
will fall under Opal

125
00:05:13.06 --> 00:05:16.05
and this is where a lot
of my content works in.

126
00:05:16.05 --> 00:05:19.02
Now if you're Bronze,
Silver, Gold, or Diamond,

127
00:05:19.02 --> 00:05:22.03
you start to get a lot more subscribers

128
00:05:22.03 --> 00:05:26.02
and YouTube will unlock
different features for you.

129
00:05:26.02 --> 00:05:28.07
For example, if you're an Opal member,

130
00:05:28.07 --> 00:05:30.05
this is going to give you the ability

131
00:05:30.05 --> 00:05:34.03
to take advantage of Creator
Days and go to local meetups

132
00:05:34.03 --> 00:05:37.05
or visit a YouTube space
or attend workshops.

133
00:05:37.05 --> 00:05:40.06
This is great because it helps
you move to the next level.

134
00:05:40.06 --> 00:05:41.06
Once you've achieved

135
00:05:41.06 --> 00:05:43.03
one of those higher level statuses though

136
00:05:43.03 --> 00:05:45.06
with having 10,000 members or above,

137
00:05:45.06 --> 00:05:48.08
YouTube actually starts to open
up their facilities to you.

138
00:05:48.08 --> 00:05:50.01
So you could actually go

139
00:05:50.01 --> 00:05:53.06
to one of the YouTube production
studios in these cities

140
00:05:53.06 --> 00:05:57.07
and record your content
or hold special events.

141
00:05:57.07 --> 00:05:59.07
You also could be eligible to enter

142
00:05:59.07 --> 00:06:01.07
to win awards and contests

143
00:06:01.07 --> 00:06:05.04
and get some consultation
on improving your channel.

144
00:06:05.04 --> 00:06:07.07
As you continue to grow in the program

145
00:06:07.07 --> 00:06:09.06
and get more and more subscribers,

146
00:06:09.06 --> 00:06:11.08
they even open up the option for

147
00:06:11.08 --> 00:06:15.02
getting a dedicated partner
manager who works with you

148
00:06:15.02 --> 00:06:18.05
and can help actually
improve your channel.

149
00:06:18.05 --> 00:06:21.09
Or you can actually take
advantage of using the spaces more

150
00:06:21.09 --> 00:06:23.07
for events and productions,

151
00:06:23.07 --> 00:06:26.06
getting regular access to YouTube Studios.

152
00:06:26.06 --> 00:06:27.04
So now that you understand

153
00:06:27.04 --> 00:06:29.01
the benefits of the Partner Program

154
00:06:29.01 --> 00:06:31.03
as well as some of the recent changes,

155
00:06:31.03 --> 00:06:33.08
let's move on to talking
about how to sign up.
