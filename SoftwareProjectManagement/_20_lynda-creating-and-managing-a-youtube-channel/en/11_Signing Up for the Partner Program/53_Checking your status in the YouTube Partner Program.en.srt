1
00:00:00.06 --> 00:00:01.09
- Here is the bad news.

2
00:00:01.09 --> 00:00:03.09
Once you're in the partner program,

3
00:00:03.09 --> 00:00:05.03
it doesn't mean you're guaranteed

4
00:00:05.03 --> 00:00:08.01
to always be in the partner program.

5
00:00:08.01 --> 00:00:11.07
You have to actively
maintain and keep publishing

6
00:00:11.07 --> 00:00:16.04
your account on a regular
basis or Google may drop you.

7
00:00:16.04 --> 00:00:20.02
You still need to maintain the
same minimum of viewer hours

8
00:00:20.02 --> 00:00:21.09
and total number of viewers

9
00:00:21.09 --> 00:00:25.08
or you could find yourself
being kicked out of the program.

10
00:00:25.08 --> 00:00:27.03
So how do you keep an eye on this?

11
00:00:27.03 --> 00:00:30.04
Well, first up, if you're
using Creator Studio Classic,

12
00:00:30.04 --> 00:00:32.05
you can just log into your account

13
00:00:32.05 --> 00:00:35.01
and take a look at the analytics.

14
00:00:35.01 --> 00:00:36.04
View the watch time

15
00:00:36.04 --> 00:00:39.08
and here's where you can
easily see what's happened.

16
00:00:39.08 --> 00:00:42.05
You can download the report if
you want to check it as well,

17
00:00:42.05 --> 00:00:44.01
but this gives you a pretty good idea

18
00:00:44.01 --> 00:00:47.09
of how much content has been consumed.

19
00:00:47.09 --> 00:00:50.03
An easier way to access this directly

20
00:00:50.03 --> 00:00:53.01
is to use the analytics link here.

21
00:00:53.01 --> 00:00:56.06
This just took you right to
the analytics and watch time

22
00:00:56.06 --> 00:00:59.08
and you can see how many views you've had.

23
00:00:59.08 --> 00:01:01.04
This will help give you a pretty good idea

24
00:01:01.04 --> 00:01:03.02
on the total number of views

25
00:01:03.02 --> 00:01:06.05
and what you can do is
actually adjust this to see

26
00:01:06.05 --> 00:01:10.00
for the last 12 months if you'd like

27
00:01:10.00 --> 00:01:11.03
and it'll give you a good idea

28
00:01:11.03 --> 00:01:14.07
if you're going to be
eligible for the program.

29
00:01:14.07 --> 00:01:17.06
So I see for example that
I do have enough minutes

30
00:01:17.06 --> 00:01:20.06
to actually qualify of total views.

31
00:01:20.06 --> 00:01:23.01
And it gives you a pretty
good idea of when spikes were.

32
00:01:23.01 --> 00:01:25.05
For example, we had a
really good period here

33
00:01:25.05 --> 00:01:27.06
when we did a lot of
coverage of new software

34
00:01:27.06 --> 00:01:28.09
that just came out

35
00:01:28.09 --> 00:01:30.07
and the company decided to promote it

36
00:01:30.07 --> 00:01:32.03
and feature it as well.

37
00:01:32.03 --> 00:01:35.00
That worked out nicely.

38
00:01:35.00 --> 00:01:36.05
Now as you take a look at this,

39
00:01:36.05 --> 00:01:38.06
this will help you track what's going on

40
00:01:38.06 --> 00:01:42.01
so you can see the total
number of viewing hours.

41
00:01:42.01 --> 00:01:43.07
And remember, you can also take a look

42
00:01:43.07 --> 00:01:47.03
at your general overview to
see the number of subscribers.

43
00:01:47.03 --> 00:01:49.07
Looking at these analytics,
you can get a good idea

44
00:01:49.07 --> 00:01:52.05
of what changes have happened over time.

45
00:01:52.05 --> 00:01:54.08
If you're using the YouTube Studio Beta,

46
00:01:54.08 --> 00:01:57.05
this also provides analytics.

47
00:01:57.05 --> 00:02:01.01
Simply click on the analytics
link in the left-hand menu

48
00:02:01.01 --> 00:02:03.06
and you could take a
look at the overview tab

49
00:02:03.06 --> 00:02:05.09
to see two useful cards,

50
00:02:05.09 --> 00:02:08.07
channel watch time and video watch

51
00:02:08.07 --> 00:02:12.06
which gives you an idea on
comparison between two periods.

52
00:02:12.06 --> 00:02:16.07
If you click on these cards,
you'll get more information.

53
00:02:16.07 --> 00:02:19.03
Here is the watch time card for example

54
00:02:19.03 --> 00:02:21.09
and clicking expands the report

55
00:02:21.09 --> 00:02:24.07
and gives me additional info.

56
00:02:24.07 --> 00:02:27.04
Notice that you can
actually refine this as well

57
00:02:27.04 --> 00:02:29.07
to see what's happened over time.

58
00:02:29.07 --> 00:02:30.08
It gives you a pretty good idea

59
00:02:30.08 --> 00:02:33.01
of what's going on with your content

60
00:02:33.01 --> 00:02:36.01
so you can really make
accurate judgements.

61
00:02:36.01 --> 00:02:38.09
The ability to use analytics
can be quite helpful

62
00:02:38.09 --> 00:02:42.00
as you want to better
understand what content

63
00:02:42.00 --> 00:02:46.00
and what behaviors are connecting.

64
00:02:46.00 --> 00:02:48.05
Now if you lose your membership,

65
00:02:48.05 --> 00:02:50.06
it's going to be because you fell below

66
00:02:50.06 --> 00:02:53.08
the 1,000 subscribers minimum

67
00:02:53.08 --> 00:02:56.02
or the 4,000 watch hours.

68
00:02:56.02 --> 00:02:58.08
You need both.

69
00:02:58.08 --> 00:03:00.07
Channels that previously reached

70
00:03:00.07 --> 00:03:02.04
these requirement thresholds

71
00:03:02.04 --> 00:03:04.08
will not necessarily lose monetization

72
00:03:04.08 --> 00:03:07.09
just because they drop
below 4,000 watch hours

73
00:03:07.09 --> 00:03:09.06
or 1,000 subscribers,

74
00:03:09.06 --> 00:03:11.08
but Google does reserve the right

75
00:03:11.08 --> 00:03:13.09
if you don't maintain these thresholds

76
00:03:13.09 --> 00:03:19.02
to have the ability to kick
you out of the program.

77
00:03:19.02 --> 00:03:20.08
It comes down to this.

78
00:03:20.08 --> 00:03:23.04
Make sure that you keep your numbers up.

79
00:03:23.04 --> 00:03:27.09
Otherwise, Google at its
discretion might remove you.

80
00:03:27.09 --> 00:03:30.01
If you drop below those requirements,

81
00:03:30.01 --> 00:03:32.07
they can strongly consider dropping you.

82
00:03:32.07 --> 00:03:34.09
Or if your channel has been inactive

83
00:03:34.09 --> 00:03:37.02
and you're not uploading
or posting content

84
00:03:37.02 --> 00:03:38.08
for six months or more.

85
00:03:38.08 --> 00:03:41.02
You don't necessarily
have to upload videos.

86
00:03:41.02 --> 00:03:43.09
You can still use the
existing videos you have,

87
00:03:43.09 --> 00:03:46.07
but you need to be making
posts and replying to people

88
00:03:46.07 --> 00:03:51.05
and actively involved in
maintaining your channel.

89
00:03:51.05 --> 00:03:55.02
If you violate any of the
YouTube partner program policies,

90
00:03:55.02 --> 00:03:57.04
regardless of how successful you are

91
00:03:57.04 --> 00:03:59.07
with watch hours and subscriber count,

92
00:03:59.07 --> 00:04:01.09
you may find yourself kicked out

93
00:04:01.09 --> 00:04:05.01
so make sure you take a look
at those terms of service.

94
00:04:05.01 --> 00:04:06.00
Now in the past,

95
00:04:06.00 --> 00:04:08.02
I used to recommend the
YouTube partner program

96
00:04:08.02 --> 00:04:10.09
to just about everyone in
order to take advantage

97
00:04:10.09 --> 00:04:13.00
of some of the most
useful features in YouTube

98
00:04:13.00 --> 00:04:14.08
like links and streaming.

99
00:04:14.08 --> 00:04:17.04
You had to join the partner program.

100
00:04:17.04 --> 00:04:21.05
But YouTube has made it a lot
harder to monetize with ads.

101
00:04:21.05 --> 00:04:23.09
A big part of that, the
official part of that,

102
00:04:23.09 --> 00:04:26.02
is that they don't want
people uploading content

103
00:04:26.02 --> 00:04:27.04
they don't have the rights to

104
00:04:27.04 --> 00:04:30.08
or abusing the system
to monetize with ads.

105
00:04:30.08 --> 00:04:34.06
Google wants the ad money to
go to real content creators

106
00:04:34.06 --> 00:04:36.05
so they've been much more stringent

107
00:04:36.05 --> 00:04:39.00
about letting people in
to the partner program

108
00:04:39.00 --> 00:04:41.03
and evaluating their content

109
00:04:41.03 --> 00:04:44.03
as well as making sure that
people get actual subscribers.

110
00:04:44.03 --> 00:04:46.07
It doesn't matter that
you get a lot of views

111
00:04:46.07 --> 00:04:49.00
because you uploaded some pirated content.

112
00:04:49.00 --> 00:04:50.09
People aren't subscribing to your channel

113
00:04:50.09 --> 00:04:53.00
because you're not providing good stuff.

114
00:04:53.00 --> 00:04:56.03
Therefore, you're ineligible
for the partner program.

115
00:04:56.03 --> 00:04:58.07
Now fortunately, most of the cool stuff

116
00:04:58.07 --> 00:05:02.03
that used to be requirements
of joining the partner program

117
00:05:02.03 --> 00:05:05.04
and dependent upon it,
well that's changed.

118
00:05:05.04 --> 00:05:06.03
You don't have to worry

119
00:05:06.03 --> 00:05:08.01
about being a member
of the partner program

120
00:05:08.01 --> 00:05:11.00
to do live streaming or
to take advantage of cards

121
00:05:11.00 --> 00:05:13.01
or to have custom thumbnails.

122
00:05:13.01 --> 00:05:15.08
So a lot of the stuff that was most useful

123
00:05:15.08 --> 00:05:19.00
and desirable in YouTube is now decoupled

124
00:05:19.00 --> 00:05:20.08
from the partner program.

125
00:05:20.08 --> 00:05:23.04
But if monetization is your goal

126
00:05:23.04 --> 00:05:25.08
or you'd like to take
advantage of YouTube Studios

127
00:05:25.08 --> 00:05:27.09
and other facilities for your productions

128
00:05:27.09 --> 00:05:29.06
or meetings or training,

129
00:05:29.06 --> 00:05:32.04
well then join the
YouTube partner program.

130
00:05:32.04 --> 00:05:34.00
I can tell you that personally,

131
00:05:34.00 --> 00:05:36.03
I don't rely very heavily on it anymore

132
00:05:36.03 --> 00:05:39.05
because I don't use YouTube's
ad system to make money,

133
00:05:39.05 --> 00:05:42.03
but I do love the fact
that I could build in links

134
00:05:42.03 --> 00:05:44.04
to products and donations

135
00:05:44.04 --> 00:05:46.00
or to products that are for sale

136
00:05:46.00 --> 00:05:48.09
or webpages that I run
for other properties

137
00:05:48.09 --> 00:05:50.03
and to connect this all together

138
00:05:50.03 --> 00:05:52.07
in a very effective network.

139
00:05:52.07 --> 00:05:54.07
Ultimately it comes down to this.

140
00:05:54.07 --> 00:05:57.09
Figure out what's the
right fit for your channel,

141
00:05:57.09 --> 00:06:00.04
your customer or organization,

142
00:06:00.04 --> 00:06:02.09
and the content that you're making.

143
00:06:02.09 --> 00:06:06.01
Sometimes ads work and
sometimes they don't,

144
00:06:06.01 --> 00:06:08.06
but you need to determine
what's right for you.
