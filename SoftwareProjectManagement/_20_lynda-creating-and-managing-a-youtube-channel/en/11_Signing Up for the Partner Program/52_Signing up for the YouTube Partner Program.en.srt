1
00:00:00.06 --> 00:00:01.08
- In order to become a member

2
00:00:01.08 --> 00:00:03.04
of the YouTube Partner Program,

3
00:00:03.04 --> 00:00:05.02
there are a few things you need to do

4
00:00:05.02 --> 00:00:07.05
to make sure you are eligible.

5
00:00:07.05 --> 00:00:10.04
The general requirements are this.

6
00:00:10.04 --> 00:00:11.08
You are able to join

7
00:00:11.08 --> 00:00:14.09
as long as it's available in your country.

8
00:00:14.09 --> 00:00:17.04
Not all countries allow
the Partner Program

9
00:00:17.04 --> 00:00:18.04
so you have to check

10
00:00:18.04 --> 00:00:22.03
that you are a resident
of an approved country.

11
00:00:22.03 --> 00:00:25.06
Once your channel
reaches 4,000 watch hours

12
00:00:25.06 --> 00:00:29.04
in the past 12 months and
has 1,000 subscribers,

13
00:00:29.04 --> 00:00:32.08
then you are eligible for consideration.

14
00:00:32.08 --> 00:00:35.09
You have to have both pieces of content.

15
00:00:35.09 --> 00:00:38.06
So you can have tons of subscribers,

16
00:00:38.06 --> 00:00:41.06
but if you're releasing
funny 10-second videos,

17
00:00:41.06 --> 00:00:45.00
it might be really hard to
get up to 4,000 watch hours

18
00:00:45.00 --> 00:00:49.04
so consider putting in some
longer form content as well.

19
00:00:49.04 --> 00:00:52.01
You can check your status anytime

20
00:00:52.01 --> 00:00:55.04
by going over to YouTube Analytics.

21
00:00:55.04 --> 00:00:59.04
Now the availability for
the program is pretty broad.

22
00:00:59.04 --> 00:01:03.03
If you fall into any of these
countries, it's available

23
00:01:03.03 --> 00:01:08.06
and it's also available in
all of these countries too.

24
00:01:08.06 --> 00:01:11.08
So as you can see, it's most of the world.

25
00:01:11.08 --> 00:01:13.07
But there are a handful of countries

26
00:01:13.07 --> 00:01:16.05
that have restrictions about
monetizing the internet

27
00:01:16.05 --> 00:01:20.07
and you won't be able
to access the content.

28
00:01:20.07 --> 00:01:23.05
Now when you want to sign
up, it's pretty simple.

29
00:01:23.05 --> 00:01:26.08
First, sign in to YouTube.

30
00:01:26.08 --> 00:01:33.01
Then in the top right corner,
navigate to Creator Studio.

31
00:01:33.01 --> 00:01:38.04
Choose channel, status, and features.

32
00:01:38.04 --> 00:01:43.02
Then under monetization, click enable.

33
00:01:43.02 --> 00:01:44.08
Follow the on-screen steps

34
00:01:44.08 --> 00:01:48.08
and accept the YouTube
Partner Program terms.

35
00:01:48.08 --> 00:01:50.06
So once you're logged in,

36
00:01:50.06 --> 00:01:52.08
you'll see the monetization section

37
00:01:52.08 --> 00:01:56.00
and it should say that you're eligible.

38
00:01:56.00 --> 00:01:59.05
Once you click and you
accept the terms of service,

39
00:01:59.05 --> 00:02:01.03
you're basically enrolled.

40
00:02:01.03 --> 00:02:04.06
However, you will need to
set up an AdSense account

41
00:02:04.06 --> 00:02:06.06
in order to actually connect

42
00:02:06.06 --> 00:02:09.08
and get the revenue from the ads.

43
00:02:09.08 --> 00:02:12.00
And then once you've
done both of those steps,

44
00:02:12.00 --> 00:02:14.03
they'll review your channel and guidelines

45
00:02:14.03 --> 00:02:18.02
and make sure that you are
ready and in compliance.

46
00:02:18.02 --> 00:02:20.00
YouTube will have a person,

47
00:02:20.00 --> 00:02:23.05
a real person actually inspect
your channel and content

48
00:02:23.05 --> 00:02:25.03
to make sure that you're a good match.

49
00:02:25.03 --> 00:02:27.05
This is pretty easy.

50
00:02:27.05 --> 00:02:29.09
Again, just click on your channel icon

51
00:02:29.09 --> 00:02:34.01
and choose Creator Studio.

52
00:02:34.01 --> 00:02:37.04
Look at your channel

53
00:02:37.04 --> 00:02:41.01
and take a look at monetization.

54
00:02:41.01 --> 00:02:43.06
Now in this case, it says I
need to specify my country

55
00:02:43.06 --> 00:02:45.09
so I'll click

56
00:02:45.09 --> 00:02:50.06
and tell it where I am located.

57
00:02:50.06 --> 00:02:52.06
There we go.

58
00:02:52.06 --> 00:02:57.07
And I'll tell it to allow advertisements.

59
00:02:57.07 --> 00:03:05.06
I can specify if I have a website

60
00:03:05.06 --> 00:03:09.02
and it looks like it wants
me to verify my website.

61
00:03:09.02 --> 00:03:10.06
Clicking on this will give me

62
00:03:10.06 --> 00:03:13.04
a handful of verification methods.

63
00:03:13.04 --> 00:03:15.08
You'll see here that one
of the easiest methods

64
00:03:15.08 --> 00:03:18.09
is to upload a small snippet of HTML

65
00:03:18.09 --> 00:03:22.06
and this will verify that the
site is officially affiliated

66
00:03:22.06 --> 00:03:24.09
with your particular channel.

67
00:03:24.09 --> 00:03:26.09
There are other methods here that includes

68
00:03:26.09 --> 00:03:28.09
using a particular tag,

69
00:03:28.09 --> 00:03:34.01
searching by domain name
provider, or Google Analytics.

70
00:03:34.01 --> 00:03:36.00
Now once you've done all of that

71
00:03:36.00 --> 00:03:38.01
and you've linked your AdWord account,

72
00:03:38.01 --> 00:03:40.08
everything should become connected.

73
00:03:40.08 --> 00:03:42.05
I'll go ahead and click save here

74
00:03:42.05 --> 00:03:45.06
and you'll see that I'm
partway through the process.

75
00:03:45.06 --> 00:03:49.01
What it comes down to is
follow all of the instructions

76
00:03:49.01 --> 00:03:51.01
and the requirements will change,

77
00:03:51.01 --> 00:03:53.07
but essentially verify your website,

78
00:03:53.07 --> 00:03:55.09
accept their terms of service,

79
00:03:55.09 --> 00:03:59.00
go ahead and set up a
Google AdSense account

80
00:03:59.00 --> 00:04:00.07
which is where the payments go

81
00:04:00.07 --> 00:04:03.01
and if you've already got
one you can connect it,

82
00:04:03.01 --> 00:04:07.03
and then accept the terms
of service again, and wait.

83
00:04:07.03 --> 00:04:08.06
It's going to take a couple of days

84
00:04:08.06 --> 00:04:10.01
for someone from YouTube to get around

85
00:04:10.01 --> 00:04:11.07
to look at your channel,

86
00:04:11.07 --> 00:04:14.02
but someone will review it and approve it

87
00:04:14.02 --> 00:04:15.09
and you'll receive notification

88
00:04:15.09 --> 00:04:17.05
that you are in the program

89
00:04:17.05 --> 00:04:20.06
or if there are any issues
that need to be fixed.
